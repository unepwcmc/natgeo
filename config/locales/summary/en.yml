    title: Chapter 1. Executive Summary
    text_1: "
    <p>We are entering an era of unparalleled opportunity to address the global crisis facing nature.</p>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a spotlight on the threat posed by biodiversity loss not just to ecosystem health, but also to the health of humans. This has generated new momentum to realise the benefits of protected and conserved areas to their full potential.</p>
    <p>The next set of global targets for nature, <a href='https://www.cbd.int/conferences/post2020' title='View the Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework' target='_blank'>the post-2020 global biodiversity framework</a>, is due to be agreed at the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China, in October 2021. In order to make informed decisions about how to best safeguard biodiversity, the world needs to reflect and learn from the progress made against the 20 targets set for nature 10 years ago at the 10th Biodiversity Conference in Japan.</p>
    <p>The Protected Planet Report 2020 delivers the final report on progress achieved against Aichi Target 11:</p>
    <p class='center italic'>By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.</p>
    <p>When the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted Target 11 in 2010, they acknowledged that effective and equitable systems of protected areas are an essential tool to address the biodiversity crisis. They also made the important decision to recognise 'other effective area-based conservation measures' (OECMs) for the first time.</p>
    <p>The Report concludes that:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Since 2010, protected areas covering almost 21 million km<sup>2</sup> – greater than the land area of the Russian Federation – have been added to the global network, with new protected areas being added every month as national governments and other stakeholders expand their efforts.</li>
    <li>Since OECMs were first recorded in 2019, these areas have added a further 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup> to the global network. Despite being limited to only five countries and territories, the available data on OECMs already show that they make a significant contribution to coverage and connectivity. Of the area now covered by protected areas and OECMs, 42% was added in the past decade.</li>
    <li>Although the data available at the time of publication show only 16.64% coverage of terrestrial and inland water areas by protected areas and OECMs, it is clear that with further updates the 17% coverage target will be surpassed, especially as more OECMs are identified, mapped, and reported.</li>
    <li>The greatest growth in protected areas and OECMs over the 10 year period has been in marine and coastal areas, where 68% of the current network's area is less than ten years old. Much of this growth has been in areas within national jurisdiction, where coverage of marine protected areas and OECMs has jumped dramatically to 18.01 %. For the global ocean, the total of 7.74% falls short of the 10% coverage target, although the pending designation of several large marine protected areas will raise this figure.</li>
    <li>The world's system of protected areas and OECMs is also becoming more representative of the full range of ecosystems. 44.5% of the 821 terrestrial ecoregions meet the 17% coverage target, and 47.4% of the 232 marine ecoregions meet the 10% target. However, 5.1% of terrestrial ecoregions and 15.5% of marine ecoregions still lack any coverage at all. Among the ocean's 37 pelagic provinces, largely beyond national jurisdiction, only 10.8% meet the 10% coverage target.</li>
    <li>Further efforts are needed to ensure that all areas of importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services are conserved. To date, 33.8% of Key Biodiversity Areas lack any coverage by protected areas or OECMs in the terrestrial and inland water realms, and 33.9% in the marine realm.</li>
    <li>Data remain poor on the effectiveness of governance and management in protected areas and OECMs. This includes data on whether they are equitably governed; a factor of particular importance for people living in and around protected and conserved areas, including women and other marginalised groups. Management effectiveness assessments have been conducted across only 18.29% of the area covered by protected areas, and it is likely that many do not meet standards for full effectiveness. Greater application of the global standard for effectiveness, the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas, will help to address these weaknesses.</li>
    <li>Governance is a key contributor to effective conservation. Both protected areas and OECMs can have a variety of governance regimes: government, private, governance by indigenous peoples and local communities, or any combination of these. Data are still poor on governance diversity and quality for protected areas and OECMs. New guidance and better reporting can provide new opportunities to better recognise and support the conservation efforts of diverse groups, including indigenous peoples, local communities, and private actors.</li>
    <li>Connectivity among protected areas and OECMs is improving. 7.84% of the world's terrestrial surface is both protected and connected, facilitating the movement of species and maintenance of ecological processes. The persistence of biodiversity in the long-term – particularly in the face of climate change and processes that fragment ecosystems – depends on achieving greater connectivity.</li> 
    <li>Integrating protected areas and OECMs across landscapes and seascapes, and in development sectors, remains a crucial challenge for ensuring the persistence of biodiversity. Measurable targets for integrated land-use and marine spatial planning are needed to facilitate progress.</li>
    <li>Increasing recognition of the role that protected and conserved areas can play as nature-based solutions to climate change and other global challenges, and their contribution to realising multiple Sustainable Development Goals, provides a strong justification for investing in more effective national and global networks.</li>   
    <li>The further identification and recognition of OECMs is likely to contribute significantly to improved performance on all criteria, including connectivity, ecological representation, governance diversity and coverage (including of areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem services).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These findings merit celebration of the major progress made over the last 10 years to grow the world's network of protected and conserved areas.</p>

    text_2: "<p>Governments' and other stakeholders' efforts towards achieving Target 11 provide a foundation for future work to address existing gaps in ecological representation, connectivity, equitable governance, and coverage of areas important for biodiversity. This will necessitate careful consideration of how context-specific national targets and ambitions can be adopted, measured and reported on to realise global ambitions for scaling up effective protected and conserved areas.</p>
    <p>A global network of effective and equitable protected and conserved areas will play a vital role in safeguarding the health of people and planet for generations to come. The <span class=\"italic\">Protected Planet Report 2020</span> provides a strong starting point from which to begin working towards this ambitious goal.</p>"
