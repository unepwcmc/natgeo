subtitle: "Chapter 5"
intro: "There is good evidence that protected areas that are effectively managed will lead to improved biodiversity outcomes. According to data reported in the Global Database on Protected Areas Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME), only 21,743 protected areas have an evaluation of management effectiveness reported, which is equivalent to about 20% of the area of all protected areas in the WDPA. The lack of systematic reporting and repeat assessments, and the existence of multiple tools makes an analysis of trends on this element of the Target difficult to assess.  "
