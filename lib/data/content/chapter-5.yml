subtitle: "Chapter 5"
intro: "Protected and conserved areas increasingly cover areas of importance for biodiversity, with 65.5% of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) now partially or fully covered. However, 33.6% of terrestrial and inland water KBAs still lack coverage entirely, alongside 33.9% of marine and coastal KBAs. It remains challenging to assess coverage of areas of importance for ecosystem services." 
blockquote: "At the close of 2020, 19.9% of terrestrial and inland water KBAs were fully covered by protected areas and OECMs, but 33.6% still lacked coverage entirely. In coastal waters and the ocean, 24.2% were fully covered and 33.9% lay completely outside protected areas and OECMs (Figure x). Collating more comprehensive data on OECMs may change this picture in the future, as there is evidence that potential OECMs may be prevalent in KBAs (Donald et al., 2019)."

  - "Aichi Target 11 states that protected and conserved areas should cover ‘areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services’. The two most widely used methods – which can be used in combination (Smith et al., 2018) – for identifying such areas are Systematic Conservation Planning (Chapter 4, Box 6) and the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Standard (BirdLife International, 2018; Smith <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2018). Whilst recognising that they do not reflect areas of importance for the breadth of ecosystem services, KBAs have been used at the global scale to identify areas of importance for biodiversity and priorities for the designation of protected areas (Butchart <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2012). 16,315 KBAs have been identified to date, encompassing a range of designations, such as Alliance for Zero Extinction sites that require protection to prevent the imminent loss of rare and particularly threatened species, and Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas. The coverage of KBAs is embedded in protected area-related indicators of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and is used as the basis for the analysis in this section."

  - "For example, Algeria’s recently documented OECMs cover three KBAs that fall entirely outside protected areas."
content_3:
  - "At the national level, on average 51.8% of KBAs either fully or partially overlap with protected areas and OECMs. The average percentage of each KBA within protected areas and OECMs is 43.2% for terrestrial, 42.2% for inland water, and 44.2% for marine (within national waters), an increase of 5 percentage points or less in each case since 2010. These figures have steadily increased since the Aichi Targets were adopted in 2010, reflecting a positive trend towards increased representation of areas of importance for biodiversity."
  - "These percentages are affected by the number and distribution of protected areas and OECMs as well as Key Biodiversity Areas. An increase in the number of mapped KBAs may lead to a reduction in the average extent to which they are covered by protected areas."
content_4: 
  - "This positive trend can continue through the targeted designation of protected areas, recognition of existing protected and conserved areas, and broad-scale policy mechanisms. In the process, greater consideration should be given to areas of importance for ecosystem services (Box 8) and the use of Systematic Conservation Planning. Other measures of biodiversity importance may also prove useful, such as EDGE of Extinction sites (Zoological Society of London, 2020), Wilderness Areas (Watson <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2016; Di Marco <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2019) Ecologically or Biologically Sensitive Marine Areas (EBSAs) (Johnson <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2019), and nationally-defined areas of importance (Box 7)."

    title: 'Reflections on national processes to identify priorities for biodiversity conservation in Mexico.'
    authors: 'Andrew Rhodes Espinoza'
    org: 'Implementation Coordinator, attached to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Mexico'
    text: "Despite global and national efforts to implement effective strategies to halt biodiversity loss, drive sustainable development, and ensure resilient ecosystems and communities, much remains to be done, including in the area of gender equal representation. In developing strategies to address these challenges, countries often complement international standards (such as KBAs) with national priority-setting exercises. \n
    For example, Mexico has spent decades developing multiple exercises to identify conservation priorities in the country. Coordinated by the National Commission for the Use and Knowledge of Biodiversity (CONABIO), the analysis of gaps and omissions in conservation was a conservation planning tool based on the evaluation of protected area networks and the identification of omissions in their ecosystem representation. The approach helped to identify areas of importance for biodiversity, as well as the processes and elements that maintain it. \n
    To evaluate the state of conservation in these important areas, and the effectiveness of those covered by protected areas, the Mexican National Biodiversity Monitoring System was launched in 2015. The System determines the condition of ecosystems in Mexico by estimating the degree of conservation through an indicator of terrestrial ecosystem integrity. An equivalent system for the marine environment is still needed. \n
    In 2020, a working group was established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, CONABIO, WRI and WWF. The group’s aim is to identify and analyse area-based conservation, restoration and sustainable use measures. It will also assess how these measures can support compliance with international commitments to be adopted as part of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. Moving from an analysis of spatial priorities to comprehensive, multisectoral studies, will help to define effective area-based measures that contribute to halting the loss of nature and its ecosystem services."

    title: 'Areas of importance for ecosystem services: an overlooked element of Aichi Target 11'
    authors: 'Nigel Dudley'
    org: 'Equilibrium Research'
    text: "The importance of ecosystem services provided by protected and conserved areas is increasingly recognised (Stolton & Dudley, 2010), including for their contributions to delivering the Sustainable Development Goals (Dudley <em>et al.,</em> 2017), through food and water security, disaster risk reduction, climate change mitigation and supporting human health. Yet although Aichi Target 11 highlights “...areas of particular importance to biodiversity and ecosystem services” (our emphasis) the latter have often been ignored in reporting progress against the target. This is not surprising. Despite numerous examples of ecosystem services from individual protected and conserved areas, global or national estimates of their contributions remain inadequate. \n
    It is understandable that governments have faced challenges in implementing targets that are vague and unquantified, and for which data on progress is sparse. Attempts at measurement are either theoretical – relying heavily on potential values from genetic resources and similar that do not carry much political weight – or look at only a small range of benefits. We can make a good attempt at estimating carbon, in terms of both climate stabilisation and economic value (Maxwell <em>et al.,</em> 2020), although the latter relies on a notoriously volatile market. Water values can be calculated (Boulton <em>et al.,</em> 2016), but most countries have no way of realising these values in economic terms, treating water security from natural ecosystems as a free and undervalued good. Disaster risk reduction services, such as natural ecosystems buffering against storms and floods, are huge but often only recognised when they disappear. \n
    There is an urgent need to develop more robust metrics and monitoring systems, and transparent ways of capturing the economic and other values of ecosystem services, at both national and site level in protected and conserved areas. The practical challenges of doing this are not to be under-estimated, but the demand for doing so is now ever more critical."
