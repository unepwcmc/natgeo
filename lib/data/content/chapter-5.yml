subtitle: "Chapter 5"
intro: "There is good evidence that protected areas that are effectively managed will lead to improved biodiversity outcomes. As of September 2020, according to data reported in the Global Database on Protected Areas Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME), only 28,283 protected areas have an evaluation of management effectiveness reported, which is equivalent to about  11% of all protected areas in the WDPA. The lack of systematic reporting and repeat assessments, and the existence of multiple tools makes an analysis of trends on this element of the Target difficult to assess."
content: "Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME) evaluations, can be defined as: 'the assessment of how well protected areas are being managed – primarily the extent to which management is protecting values and achieving goals and objectives' (Hockings et al. 2006). Over the past 10 years, management effectiveness data have been gathered from 169 countries globally, using 69 different methodologies, resulting in the Global Database on Protected Areas Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME). As of 2018, the database contained 28,668 records from 21,743 different protected areas. This corresponds to data for 9.1% of protected areas reported in the WDPA, representing 19.9% of protected area coverage. As of 2018, only 21% of countries met the management effectiveness target (i.e. of having at least 60% of their protected area coverage assessed) on land and 16% of countries met the target in the ocean, according to the data held in GD-PAME."

    text: "Effectiveness needs to start from the ground up, ensuring sites are in the places most needing conservation management, that they are subject to good governance and that they deliver their goals effectively. Many tools have been developed, and adapted, for site-based management effectiveness assessments; descriptions of these tools, and details of the many thousands of sites that have used them, can be found on Protected Planet’s GD-PAME pages. What has proved difficult however is taking these site- or sometimes system-based assessments and extracting one or two indicators for global effectiveness reporting. One problem has been a confusion in what is being reported; while site-level assessments are more focussed on management, the demand at the global level has often been for data on conservation outcomes. Most PAME methodologies cannot deliver this, and often explicitly state that outcome monitoring needs other tools, systems and processes to complement management effectiveness assessment. \n
           There is an opportunity for the post-2020 effectiveness indicators to address this disparity in global and site-level expectations of effectiveness assessments, in addition to providing clarity on both the criteria and the method of reporting. One option for globally consistent indicators is to build on the advances made in remote sensing and other technologies. Appropriate resolution in time and space, data quality, and open access will be important, as will data validation. Such global indicators still need to be complemented by site-level indicators. These should focus on the condition of the biodiversity elements for which the site is valued and be based on finer-scale biodiversity inventories and capture details of change that more coarse-scale remote sensed measures cannot (Maxwell et al, 2020)."
