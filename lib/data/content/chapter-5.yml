subtitle: "Chapter 5"
intro: "Protected and conserved areas increasingly cover areas of importance for biodiversity, with 65.5% of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) now partially or fully covered. However, 33.6% of terrestrial and inland water KBAs still lack coverage entirely, alongside 33.9% of marine and coastal KBAs. It remains challenging to assess coverage of areas of importance for ecosystem services."

    "Aichi Target 11 states that protected and conserved areas should cover ‘areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services’. The two most widely used methods – which can be used in combination (Smith et al., 2018) – for identifying such areas are Systematic Conservation Planning (Section 4, Box 7) and the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Standard (BirdLife International, 2018; Smith et al., 2019). With some exceptions, KBAs are recommended as suitable sites for the designation of protected areas (Butchart et al., 2012), and are used as the basis for this section.  "
  -
    "Globally at the close of 2020, xx% of terrestrial and inland water KBAs are fully covered by protected areas, but xx% still lack protection entirely. In coastal waters and the ocean, xx% are fully covered and xx% lie completely outside protected areas (Figure x). Collating more comprehensive data on OECMs may change this picture in the future, as there is evidence that potential OECMs may be prevalent in KBAs (Donald et al., 2019). For example, Canada’s recently documented OECMs increase the proportion of KBAs with full or partial coverage from xx% to xx%."

    "Statistics in this chapter have three sources:"
  -
    "<ol><li>Statistics on KBA coverage by number use the January 2021 release of the WDPA and WD-OECM and the KBA 2020 02 release of the WDKBA These statistics represent the number of KBAs that are fully or partially protected per country and are calculated by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). More information on this indicator and how it is calculated can be found here.</li>"
  -
    "<li>Statistics on whether individual KBAs are partially, fully or not protected were calculated by UNEP-WCMC using the January 2021 release of the WDPA and WD-OECM and the KBA 2020 02 release of the WDKBA. This is an intersect of the KBA data with the January 2021 WDPA and WD-OECM – the overlapping areas are calculated and compared to the size of the whole KBA. Sites that are <2% covered by KBAs are considered not covered. Sites >98% covered are fully covered and those in between are considered partially covered.</li>"
  -
    "<li>Statistics on KBA coverage over time or by specific biomes (e.g. freshwater) derive from statistics calculated by BirdLife International, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC for SDG indicators 14.5.1, 15.1.2 and 15.4.1. These data used the November 2020 release of the WDPA and WD-OECM and the KBA 2020 02 release of the WDKBA the methodology can be found here.</li>"
content_2: "At the national level, the average percentage of each KBA within protected areas [and OECMs] is xx% for terrestrial, xx% for inland water, and xx% for marine (within EEZ). These figures have steadily increased since the Aichi Targets were adopted in 2010 (Figure x), reflecting a positive trend towards increased representation of areas important for biodiversity.  "
content_3: "After 2020, this positive trend can be extended through the targeted designation of protected areas and recognition of existing conserved areas. In the process, greater consideration should be given to areas of importance for ecosystem services (Box 6) and the use of Systematic Conservation Planning (Section 4, Box 7). Other measures of biodiversity importance may also prove useful, such as EDGE of Extinction sites (Zoological Society of London, 2020), Wilderness Areas (Watson et al., 2016; Di Marco et al., 2019), Ecologically or Biologically Sensitive Marine Areas (EBSAs) (Johnson et al., 2019), and nationally-defined areas of importance (Box 5).

    "As of 2018, 21% (5,510) of globally threatened species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™ are found within KBAs in Biodiversity Hotspots. Of these sites, 13% are currently fully within protected areas, while another 31% are covered only in part by protected areas."
  -
    "Another approach is based on the ‘Evolutionary Distinctiveness’ (the unique contribution of a species to total evolutionary history) and ‘Global Endangerment’ (extinction risk derived from the IUCN Red List) of species. A total of 1,261 or 43% of all EDGE species are found in 2,803 KBAs in 21 Biodiversity Hotspots, with 14% of these sites with EDGE species being fully within protected areas and 35% partially within protected areas."
  -
    "There is currently no global dataset or analysis that provides a measure of how well protected areas cover ‘areas of particular importance for ecosystem services’, which constitutes a clear gap to be addressed to fully report progress in the achievement of Aichi Target 11."

    title: 'Reflections on national processes to identify priorities for biodiversity conservation in Mexico.'
    authors: 'Andrew Rhodes Espinoza'
    org: 'Implementation Coordinator, attached to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Mexico'
    text: "Despite global and national efforts to implement effective strategies to halt biodiversity loss, drive sustainable development, and ensure resilient ecosystems and communities, much remains to be done, including in the area of gender equal representation. In developing strategies to address these challenges, countries often complement international standards (such as KBAs) with national priority-setting exercises. \n

      For example, Mexico has spent decades developing multiple exercises to identify conservation priorities in the country. Coordinated by the National Commission for the Use and Knowledge of Biodiversity (CONABIO), the analysis of gaps and omissions in conservation was a conservation planning tool based on the evaluation of protected area networks and the identification of omissions in their ecosystem representation. The approach helped to identify areas of importance for biodiversity, as well as the processes and elements that maintain it. \n

      To evaluate the state of conservation in these important areas, and the effectiveness of those covered by protected areas, the Mexican National Biodiversity Monitoring System was launched in 2015. The System determines the condition of ecosystems in Mexico by estimating the degree of conservation through an indicator of terrestrial ecosystem integrity. An equivalent system for the marine environment is still needed. \n

      In 2020, a working group was established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, CONABIO, WRI and WWF. The group’s aim is to identify and analyse area-based conservation, restoration and sustainable use measures. It will also assess how these measures can support compliance with international commitments to be adopted as part of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. Moving from an analysis of spatial priorities to comprehensive, multisectoral studies, will help to define effective area-based measures that contribute to halting the loss of nature and its ecosystem services."

    title: 'Areas of importance for ecosystem services: an overlooked element of Aichi Target 11'
    authors: 'Nigel Dudley'
    org: 'Equilibrium Research'
    text: "The importance of ecosystem services provided by protected and conserved areas is increasingly recognised (Stolton & Dudley, 2010), including for their contributions to delivering the Sustainable Development Goals (Dudley <em>et al.,</em> 2017), through food and water security, disaster risk reduction, climate change mitigation and supporting human health. Yet although Aichi Target 11 highlights “...areas of particular importance to biodiversity and ecosystem services” (our emphasis) the latter have often been ignored in reporting progress against the target. This is not surprising. Despite numerous examples of ecosystem services from individual protected and conserved areas, global or national estimates of their contributions remain inadequate. \n

        It is understandable that governments have faced challenges in implementing targets that are vague and unquantified, and for which data on progress is sparse. Attempts at measurement are either theoretical – relying heavily on potential values from genetic resources and similar that do not carry much political weight – or look at only a small range of benefits. We can make a good attempt at estimating carbon, in terms of both climate stabilisation and economic value (Maxwell <em>et al.,</em> 2020), although the latter relies on a notoriously volatile market. Water values can be calculated (Boulton <em>et al.,</em> 2016), but most countries have no way of realising these values in economic terms, treating water security from natural ecosystems as a free and undervalued good. Disaster risk reduction services, such as natural ecosystems buffering against storms and floods, are huge but often only recognised when they disappear. \n

        There is an urgent need to develop more robust metrics and monitoring systems, and transparent ways of capturing the economic and other values of ecosystem services, at both national and site level in protected and conserved areas. The practical challenges of doing this are not to be under-estimated, but the demand for doing so is now ever more critical."
