    "Aichi Target 11 states that protected and conserved areas should cover ‘areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services’. The two most widely used methods – which can be used in combination (Smith et al., 2018) – for identifying such areas are Systematic Conservation Planning (Section 4, Box 7) and the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Standard (BirdLife International, 2018; Smith et al., 2019). With some exceptions, KBAs are recommended as suitable sites for the designation of protected areas (Butchart et al., 2012), and are used as the basis for this section.  "

    "Globally at the close of 2020, xx% of terrestrial and inland water KBAs are fully covered by protected areas, but xx% still lack protection entirely. In coastal waters and the ocean, xx% are fully covered and xx% lie completely outside protected areas (Figure x). Collating more comprehensive data on OECMs may change this picture in the future, as there is evidence that potential OECMs may be prevalent in KBAs (Donald et al., 2019). For example, Canada’s recently documented OECMs increase the proportion of KBAs with full or partial coverage from xx% to xx%.  "
content_2: "At the national level, the average percentage of each KBA within protected areas [and OECMs] is xx% for terrestrial, xx% for inland water, and xx% for marine (within EEZ). These figures have steadily increased since the Aichi Targets were adopted in 2010 (Figure x), reflecting a positive trend towards increased representation of areas important for biodiversity.  "
content_3: "After 2020, this positive trend can be extended through the targeted designation of protected areas and recognition of existing conserved areas. In the process, greater consideration should be given to areas of importance for ecosystem services (Box 6) and the use of Systematic Conservation Planning (Section 4, Box 7). Other measures of biodiversity importance may also prove useful, such as EDGE of Extinction sites (Zoological Society of London, 2020), Wilderness Areas (Watson et al., 2016; Di Marco et al., 2019), Ecologically or Biologically Sensitive Marine Areas (EBSAs) (Johnson et al., 2019), and nationally-defined areas of importance (Box 5).

    "As of 2018, 21% (5,510) of globally threatened species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™ are found within KBAs in Biodiversity Hotspots. Of these sites, 13% are currently fully within protected areas, while another 31% are covered only in part by protected areas."
  -
    "Another approach is based on the ‘Evolutionary Distinctiveness’ (the unique contribution of a species to total evolutionary history) and ‘Global Endangerment’ (extinction risk derived from the IUCN Red List) of species. A total of 1,261 or 43% of all EDGE species are found in 2,803 KBAs in 21 Biodiversity Hotspots, with 14% of these sites with EDGE species being fully within protected areas and 35% partially within protected areas."
  -
    "There is currently no global dataset or analysis that provides a measure of how well protected areas cover ‘areas of particular importance for ecosystem services’, which constitutes a clear gap to be addressed to fully report progress in the achievement of Aichi Target 11."

    title: 'Tracking management effectiveness after 2020'
    authors: 'Sue Stolton'

    text: "Effectiveness needs to start from the ground up, ensuring sites are in the places most needing conservation management, that they are subject to good governance and that they deliver their goals effectively. Many tools have been developed, and adapted, for site-based management effectiveness assessments; descriptions of these tools, and details of the many thousands of sites that have used them, can be found on Protected Planet’s GD-PAME pages. What has proved difficult however is taking these site- or sometimes system-based assessments and extracting one or two indicators for global effectiveness reporting. One problem has been a confusion in what is being reported; while site-level assessments are more focussed on management, the demand at the global level has often been for data on conservation outcomes. Most PAME methodologies cannot deliver this, and often explicitly state that outcome monitoring needs other tools, systems and processes to complement management effectiveness assessment. \n
           There is an opportunity for the post-2020 effectiveness indicators to address this disparity in global and site-level expectations of effectiveness assessments, in addition to providing clarity on both the criteria and the method of reporting. One option for globally consistent indicators is to build on the advances made in remote sensing and other technologies. Appropriate resolution in time and space, data quality, and open access will be important, as will data validation. Such global indicators still need to be complemented by site-level indicators. These should focus on the condition of the biodiversity elements for which the site is valued and be based on finer-scale biodiversity inventories and capture details of change that more coarse-scale remote sensed measures cannot (Maxwell et al, 2020)."
