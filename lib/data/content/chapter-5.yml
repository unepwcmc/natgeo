subtitle: "Chapter 5"
intro: "There is good evidence that protected areas that are effectively managed will lead to improved biodiversity outcomes. According to data reported in the Global Database on Protected Areas Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME), only 21,743 protected areas have an evaluation of management effectiveness reported, which is equivalent to about 20% of the area of all protected areas in the WDPA. The lack of systematic reporting and repeat assessments, and the existence of multiple tools makes an analysis of trends on this element of the Target difficult to assess."

content_2: "In terms of regional differences in coverage of protected areas assessed for management effectiveness, no regions meet the 60% assessment target. Only Africa and North America have more than 30% of the total area of their protected area network assessed."

content_3: "In terms of the number of records regionally, the highest number is found in Europe, where many small protected areas are found, many of them having been repeatedly assessed and hence driving up the numbers of reported assessments."
