subtitle: "Chapter 5"
intro: "There is good evidence that protected areas that are effectively managed will lead to improved biodiversity outcomes. As of 2018, according to data reported in the Global Database on Protected Areas Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME), only 21,743 protected areas have an evaluation of management effectiveness reported, which is equivalent to about 20% of the area of all protected areas in the WDPA. The lack of systematic reporting and repeat assessments, and the existence of multiple tools makes an analysis of trends on this element of the Target difficult to assess."
content: "Over the past 10 years, management effectiveness data have been gathered from 169 countries globally, using 69 different methodologies, resulting in the Global Database on Protected Areas Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME). As of 2018, the database contained 28,668 records from 21,743 different protected areas. This corresponds to data for 9.1% of protected areas reported in the WDPA, representing 19.9% of protected area coverage. As of 2018, only 21% of countries met the management effectiveness target (i.e. of having at least 60% of their protected area coverage assessed) on land and 16% of countries met the target in the ocean, according to the data held in GD-PAME."
