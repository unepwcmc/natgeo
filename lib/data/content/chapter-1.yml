aichi_text: "Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2010-2020 calls for Parties to achieve the following: ‘By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape’."

    "Protected and conserved areas have long been a successful management tool to conserve biodiversity, and without them, the global loss of biodiversity would likely be even greater. IUCN defines a protected area as ‘a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values’."
  -
    "Protected Planet Reports are biennial landmark publications that assess the state of protected areas around the world. The Report Series started in 2012, when Parties to the CBD encouraged UNEP-WCMC and IUCN ‘to continue to report on progress towards achieving Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 and related targets through the Protected Planet Report’. These reports use the data contained in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and other relevant information sources to evaluate progress towards global commitments related to protected areas. In this edition of the Protected Planet Report, we review and update progress made at the global level towards achieving Aichi Target 11, with each chapter looking at each specific element of the target."

    description: "Women are often the primary users of natural resources and play a key role in their management. However, they often do not have ownership and control over land and resources and they tend to be disproportionally affected by the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, if empowered, they can contribute to the sustainability of resource use. For instance, if protected areas are equitably managed, they can help reducing gender inequalities."

Protected areas provide a significant proportion of the drinking water for many of the world’s largest cities. Protection of water towers, cloud forests, forested catchments for water, and natural floodplains is therefore essential to ensure freshwater supply and reduce disaster risks."

    description: "Species and ecosystems are already being impacted by climate change. It is therefore crucial to protect them, not only to preserve biodiversity, but also their capacity to contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation. Indeed, many natural ecosystems provide globally significant carbon stores, and healthy ecosystems are key to enhance resilience to climate change, for instance by acting as natural buffers against extreme climatic events."

    description: "Marine protected areas contribute directly to this goal. The conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in marine and coastal ecosystems is key to sustainable development. Biodiversity indeed underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities. Protecting marine and coastal areas is thus essential to ensure that the world’s oceans, seas and marine resources are preserved."

    description: "Terrestrial protected areas contribute directly to this goal. Although there has been a marked increase in protected area coverage, many areas important for biodiversity are still not adequately protected. The designation of protected areas has played a crucial role in preventing deforestation and is likely to have contributed to the conservation of several vertebrate species. Protected areas are thus key to protect terrestrial habitats, species, and ecosystem services."

    title: 'The road to the Protected Planet Report 2020'
    text: "As the final instalment in the series focused on Aichi Target 11, it is important that this Protected Planet Report is based on the best available data. Over the past three years, significant efforts have been made to secure those data. The Aichi Target 11 Partnership (ref) was established in 2018 to ensure coordination among partners, and to stimulate support for activities that could contribute to the achievement of Target 11. UNEP-WCMC sent notifications requesting updates to the WDPA and, where possible, the WD-OECM, to all governments in July 2019 (supported by a CBD notification) and September 2020.\n
           These notifications were met by an unprecedented response. Parties to the CBD rallied to provide data on xx,000 new protected areas to the WDPA – an increase of xx,000 on 2010 figures – bringing the total records in the database to over 260,000. Canada and Guernsey made history by being the first to record other effective area-based conservation measures in the WD-OECM. In 2020, UNEP-WCMC processed more records, added more new protected areas and updated more national protected area networks than in any other year in the WDPA’s history. This was made possible in large part by the tireless efforts of the CBD Secretariat to encourage Parties to update their data.\n
           Nevertheless, more work can be done. As discussed later in this report, protected areas under non-state governance remain under-reported to the WDPA. The potential role and importance of OECMs and other conserved areas also cannot be downplayed. Their extent may be enormous, and it is essential that they are identified, recognised and supported before being counted towards the targets of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. While addressing the lack of data on non-state protected areas and OECMs may be a challenge, it is also an unparalleled opportunity to recognise the role of diverse actors in achieving the CBD’s 2050 vision."

    title: 'A note on terminology'
    text: 'Throughout this report, the term ‘protected and conserved areas’ is used to collectively describe all sites that aim to achieve, or are effective in achieving, conservation outcomes. Conserved areas include a wide range of sites that deliver effective conservation outcomes, but where the site may have been established for other reasons. Included in this broad range of conserved areas are those defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity as OECMs. Although we refer broadly to ‘conserved areas’ throughout the text, the statistics, maps and figures are derived specifically from data on OECMs, rather than conserved areas more broadly.'

    title: 'COVID-19: impacts on conservation areas and opportunities for change'
    authors: 'Mariana Napolitano Ferreira and Rachel Golden Kroner'
    org: 'Co-chairs IUCN WCPA Task Force on COVID-19 and Protected Areas'
    text: "The effects of COVID-19 on human health and economies are evident in protected areas and OECMs around the world. In addition to concerning negative impacts on management capacity, budgets and effectiveness, there have been significant impacts on the livelihoods of communities living in and around these areas.\n 
          Nearly half of PA agencies surveyed across 19 African countries reported that they could only maintain basic operations for up to three months if the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 continued to be in force . The loss of income resulting from these restrictions significantly affected their ability to pay salaries, monitor illegal wildlife trade and protect local communities from damages caused by wildlife. The sudden closure of tourism has also caused jobs losses, undermined development projects, and weakened collaboration with investors.\n          
          With economic recovery being a critical priority in the forthcoming years, arguments for rolling back environmental protections are gaining traction. For example, provisions that would authorise new or expanded extractive industries and infrastructure activities in protected and conserved areas. This is especially of concern in countries where these areas are already under severe pressure . Such arguments are short-sighted and could exacerbate problems such as ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss that increase the risk of pandemics.\n
          Protected and conserved areas could be a central piece of economic stimulus packages after COVID-19 (e.g. [ref Pakistan example]). These conservation systems provide both direct short- and long-term economic benefits, assist vulnerable communities, and address policy needs. They also bolster national economies, maintain vital ecosystem services, and mitigate climate change . Recovery plans, including the establishment of rapid response grants, the maintenance of essential services, and support to local communities, must be followed by actions. These actions include promoting the health-related benefits of protected and conserved areas, restoring management capacities, and implementing strategies that ensure equitable governance and benefit-sharing mechanisms.\n
          Recognising the benefits of protected and conserved areas, and supporting their effectiveness, will help countries rebuild after COVID-19 while simultaneously reducing the risk of future pandemics. Encouragingly, leaders from many parts of the world, including the European Union , Finland , New Zealand , Pakistan , Iceland , Kenya , the United Kingdom , and the United States of America , have already signalled their intention to take advantage of this in their recovery plans. Other countries have the opportunity to follow, supporting protected and conserved areas to v biodiversity, climate, and Sustainable Development Goals."
