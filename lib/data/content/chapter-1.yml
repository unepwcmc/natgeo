achi_target: "Aichi Target 11"
achi_text: "Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2010-2020 calls for Parties to achieve the following: ‘By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape’."
achi_text_2: "Protected and conserved areas have long been a successful management tool to conserve biodiversity, and without them, the global loss of biodiversity would likely be even greater. IUCN defines a protected area as ‘a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values’. Protected Planet Reports are biennial landmark publications that assess the state of protected areas around the world. The Report Series started in 2012, when Parties to the CBD encouraged UNEP-WCMC and IUCN ‘to continue to report on progress towards achieving Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 and related targets through the Protected Planet Report’. These reports use the data contained in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and other relevant information sources to evaluate progress towards global commitments related to protected areas. In this edition of the Protected Planet Report, we review and update progress made at the global level towards achieving Aichi Target 11, with each chapter looking at each specific element of the target."
