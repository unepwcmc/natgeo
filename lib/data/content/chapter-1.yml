    "Systems of protected and conserved areas will not function effectively if they do not cover a representative sample of the world’s ecosystems and species. It is possible to assess ecological representation based on the proportion of species’ distributions covered by protected and conserved areas. However, coverage of ecoregions (ecological units of land, ocean or freshwater that share the same biological characteristics (Olson et al. 2001; Spalding et al. 2007 and 2012)) is more generally used to assess this element of Aichi Target 11 (Gannon et al. 2019). This is the metric used here."

    "Since 2012, the percentage of terrestrial ecoregions reaching the 17% target has increased by xx%. The improvement is even more pronounced in the marine realm, with an increase of xx%. Furthermore, the percentage of ecoregions entirely lacking protection (less than 1% coverage by protected areas) has decreased from xx% to xx%."
