aichi_text: "Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2010-2020 calls for Parties to achieve the following: ‘By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape’."

    "Protected and conserved areas have long been a successful management tool to conserve biodiversity, and without them, the global loss of biodiversity would likely be even greater. IUCN defines a protected area as ‘a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values’."
  -
    "Protected Planet Reports are biennial landmark publications that assess the state of protected areas around the world. The Report Series started in 2012, when Parties to the CBD encouraged UNEP-WCMC and IUCN ‘to continue to report on progress towards achieving Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 and related targets through the Protected Planet Report’. These reports use the data contained in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and other relevant information sources to evaluate progress towards global commitments related to protected areas. In this edition of the Protected Planet Report, we review and update progress made at the global level towards achieving Aichi Target 11, with each chapter looking at each specific element of the target."

    description: "All food systems depend on biodiversity and ecosystem services that support agricultural productivity, soil fertility, and water quality and supply. By protecting these key ecosystem services, protected areas can contribute to enhance food security. Protected areas also provide basic supporting services such as soil production and stabilisation of water supplies, as well as buffering against extreme climatic events."

    colour: "#FF3A21"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-05.png'
    description: "Women are often the primary users of natural resources and play a key role in their management. However, they often do not have ownership and control over land and resources and they tend to be disproportionally affected by the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, if empowered, they can contribute to the sustainability of resource use. For instance, if protected areas are equitably managed, they can help reducing gender inequalities."

    colour: "#26BDE2"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-06.png'
    description: "The delivery of water supplies and water quality require healthy ecosystems, which can also help prevent water-related hazards and disasters. Protected areas provide a significant proportion of the drinking water for many of the world’s largest cities. Protection of water towers, cloud forests, forested catchments for water, and natural floodplains is therefore essential to ensure freshwater supply and reduce disaster risks."

    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-08.png'
    description: "Biodiversity supports the provision of ecosystem services which are key to almost all economic activities. By preserving ecosystem functions, protected areas can lead to higher productivity and more efficient resource use. They can also offer opportunities for business development, especially in rural and remote areas. Nature tourism, including visits to protected areas, is one of the fastest-growing sectors."

    title: "Industry, innovation and infrastructure"
    colour: "#FD6925"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-09.png'
    description: "Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems can provide reliable and affordable natural infrastructure. For instance, coral reefs and mangrove forests protect coasts against flooding that are expected to increase with climate change. It is therefore particularly important for these areas to be protected."

    title: "Reduced inequalities"
    colour: "#DD1367"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-10.png'
    description: "Larger income inequality within countries have been shown to be related to greater biodiversity loss. In recent years, there has been a significant shift from protected areas solely managed by governments to protected areas managed by indigenous and local communities, or under shared governance. Increasing the recognition of the role of indigenous and local people in protected area management will contribute to reducing inequalities."

    title: "Sustainable cites and communities"
    colour: "#FD9D24"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-11.png'
    description: "The global urban population is expected to reach 5 billion by 2030. Ecosystems and biodiversity deliver all the basic services that enable human production, consumption and habitation, such as protection from extreme weather events. Urban planning that integrates biodiversity, for instance through the creation of urban parks, can provide important buffers for urban centres and contribute to more sustainable cities."

    title: "Responsible consumption and production"
    colour: "#BF8B2E"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-12.png'
    description: "Consumption and production of all goods and services rely on the use of natural resources, which in turn impacts biodiversity. Unsustainable consumption patterns can undermine the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. Supporting local communities, especially the ones living in and around protected areas, is necessary to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources."

    title: "Climate action"
    colour: "#3F7E44"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-13.png'
    description: "Species and ecosystems are already being impacted by climate change. It is therefore crucial to protect them, not only to preserve biodiversity, but also their capacity to contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation. Indeed, many natural ecosystems provide globally significant carbon stores, and healthy ecosystems are key to enhance resilience to climate change, for instance by acting as natural buffers against extreme climatic events."

    title: "Life below water"
    colour: "#0A97D9"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-14.png'
    description: "Marine protected areas contribute directly to this goal. The conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in marine and coastal ecosystems is key to sustainable development. Biodiversity indeed underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities. Protecting marine and coastal areas is thus essential to ensure that the world’s oceans, seas and marine resources are preserved."

    title: "Life on land"
    colour: "#56C02B"
    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-15.png'
    description: "Terrestrial protected areas contribute directly to this goal. Although there has been a marked increase in protected area coverage, many areas important for biodiversity are still not adequately protected. The designation of protected areas has played a crucial role in preventing deforestation and is likely to have contributed to the conservation of several vertebrate species. Protected areas are thus key to protect terrestrial habitats, species, and ecosystem services."

    icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-16.png'
    description: "Environmental crime undermine sustainable development and threaten global security. Furthermore, conflicts over natural resources and environmental degradation can lead to social insecurity. Enhancing the role of law and equity for governance of biodiversity, including protected areas, can contribute to building an inclusive society based on justice and democratic values."
