    "The past decade has seen marine protected area coverage increase by xx%, and terrestrial by xx%. The decade has also seen increases in connectivity, ecological representation and coverage of important areas for biodiversity. While it remains challenging to assess management effectiveness and equitable governance at the global level, assessments of both are being conducted more widely and methodologies are being refined. In the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook, Target 11 stood out as one of the few to have been partially achieved (CBD, 2020).  "

    "In 2020, the concept of protected and conserved areas is better understood than ever, as we close the decade with guidance on governance diversity (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2013), a host of best practice guidelines for protected and conserved areas (ref), a Green List standard to support effective governance and management, and a definition to guide the identification of OECMs (CBD, 2018). With better data (Bingham et al. 2019), new methodologies (protconn ref), and evolving and ever-improving technologies like remote sensing, we now have the means to monitor the world’s protected and conserved areas in ways that were near impossible in 2010.

    "Although this report has described several shortfalls in achieving Aichi Target 11, this should not be cause for despondency or a loss of momentum after 2020. It should be remembered that the Aichi Targets and the goals that will succeed them are a means to an end. That end is articulated in the CBD’s 2050 vision: "

blockquote_text: "By 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people. "

  - "Achieving the 2050 vision will be challenging, but the governments of the world appear poised to take up this challenge through adopting the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, with its ambitious draft targets and focus on system-level conservation and sustainable use. Although the adoption of the Framework has been delayed, many governments and other actors are already promising more ambitious action on biodiversity loss (e.g. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.leaderspledgefornature.org\">Leaders' Pledge for Nature</a>)."
  - "No summary of the decade can be complete without an acknowledgement of the way it ended. COVID-19 has devastated lives, livelihoods and economies. It has forced us to recognise that biodiversity loss cannot continue. When governments adopt the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, they will do so with the knowledge that their commitments must be translated into action, and that halting biodiversity loss is no longer optional. The Protected Planet Report offers the following recommendations to support the implementation of the Framework:":
    1: "Protected and conserved area expansion can be achieved in part by recognising the existing efforts of indigenous peoples, local communities and private actors. These areas should be supported in ways deemed appropriate by their custodians, whose rights and responsibilities should be recognised. OECMs across all governance types should be identified, recognised and supported with the consent of their custodians.  "
    2: "New protected and conserved areas should be designated with a focus on the network as a whole: new designations should enhance connectivity, ecological representation, and coverage of areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Transboundary and regional cooperation should be scaled up.  "
    3: "Particular efforts are needed to expand marine protected and conserved areas beyond coastal waters, including in areas beyond national jurisdiction.  "
    4: "Assessments of effective and equitable governance and management should be widely applied. Global indicators should be developed, refined and operationalised.  "
    5: "The biodiversity outcomes of protected and conserved areas should be monitored. Global indicators should be developed, refined and operationalised.  "
    6: "Protected and conserved areas should be integrated across national policies and planning.  "
    7: "Data on all protected areas and OECMs should be reported to the Protected Planet Initiative with the consent of their custodians, reducing uncertainty (Box 14) in tracking progress towards the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.  "

    title: How certain is the status of Aichi Target 11?
    text: "The Protected Planet Report relies heavily on the WDPA. Parties to the CBD recognise the database as the official source of indicators on Aichi Target 11, and almost all national governments have contributed data. The WDPA has been growing for decades, and extensive efforts have been made over the past two years to ensure that the 2020 Protected Planet Report is based on the best available data (see Box 1). However, no global database relying on 500 data-providers can be entirely accurate, and there are several key sources of uncertainty:\n
            •	The WDPA under-represents protected areas under non-state governance (see Box 4). \n
            •	There is often a delay between the designation of a protected area and its inclusion in the WDPA (ref). Some protected areas designated in recent years may not yet be included.\n
            •	Although the WDPA uses the IUCN definition of a protected area, some data-providers may have reported information on sites that do not adhere to this definition. \n
          In addition, OECMs remain largely undocumented, and the data available in the WD-OECM is extremely limited. The true contributions of OECMs to Aichi Target 11 are therefore not known.  However, it will be important that OECMs are appropriately recognised and supported before they are counted towards governments’ global commitments. Similarly, assessments of management effectiveness are known to be under-reported to the GD-PAME. \n
          Every effort has been made to mitigate these challenges, but a degree of uncertainty remains. As a result, future analyses may paint a different picture of the status of the world’s conservation network at the end of 2020. For now, the Protected Planet Report provides the most accurate and complete assessment of the status of Aichi Target 11. "
