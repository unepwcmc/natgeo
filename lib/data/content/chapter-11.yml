    "The past decade has seen substantial gains in coverage, with 42% of the area now within protected and conserved areas added to the network since 2010. The extraordinary potential of OECMs to further enhance these figures is clear from this report, with data from only a handful of countries already having an impact that can be seen at the global level. The decade has also seen increases in connectivity, ecological representation and coverage of important areas for biodiversity. While it remains challenging to assess management effectiveness and equitable governance at the global level, assessments of both are being conducted more widely and methodologies are being refined. These elements, too, are likely to be dramatically affected by OECMs as more data become available over the coming years."

    "In the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook, Target 11 stood out as one of the few to have been partially achieved (CBD, 2020). When the available data are disaggregated to the regional level, it becomes clear that the global picture obscures even more positive progress in some regions (e.g. Latin America and the Caribbean, Box 14), and this is not the only reason for optimism. In 2021, the concept of protected and conserved areas is better understood than ever, as we close the decade with guidance on governance diversity (Borrini-Feyerabend <em>et al.</em>, 2013), a Green List standard to support the effective management and governance of protected and conserved areas (including through advancing gender equity) (IUCN and WCPA, 2017), an MPA Guide supporting a shared understanding of conservation in the marine realm (Oregon State University <em>et al.</em>, 2019), and a definition to guide the identification of OECMs (CBD, 2018). With better data (Bingham <em>et al.</em>, 2019), new methodologies (e.g. Saura <em>et al.</em>, 2017), and evolving and ever-improving technologies like remote sensing, we now have the means to monitor the world’s protected and conserved areas in ways that were out of reach in 2010.

    "Nevertheless, biodiversity continues to decline and there have been clear shortfalls in the achievement of Aichi Target 11."

blockquote_text: "The need for more and better protected and conserved areas is as urgent as ever, and it is therefore essential that the shortfalls described in this report are not taken as cause for despondency or a loss of momentum for the future."

content_2: " The Aichi Targets and the ambitions that will succeed them have always been a milestone towards the CBD’s 2050 Vision for Biodiversity:"

blockquote_text_2: "By 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people."

  - "Achieving this vision will be challenging, but governments around the world are taking up this challenge through the development of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework as a roadmap towards the vision. Alongside the development and adoption of the framework, many governments and other actors are already committing to more ambitious action on biodiversity loss (e.g. United Nations, 2020; <a href='www.leaderspledgefornature.org/' title='Visit the Leaders Pledge for Nature' target='_blank'>Leaders' Pledge for Nature</a>). "
  - "No summary of the decade can be complete without an acknowledgement of the way it ended."

blockquote_text_3: "COVID-19 (Box 15) has devastated lives, livelihoods and economies. It has forced us to recognise that biodiversity loss cannot continue."

  - "When governments adopt the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, they will do so with the knowledge that their commitments must be followed by action, and that the wellbeing of people and planet depend on addressing the biodiversity crisis. The Protected Planet Report 2020 identifies the following opportunities to support the implementation of the framework, accompanied by efforts to address the broader drivers of biodiversity loss:":
    1: "Protected and conserved area expansion can be achieved in part by recognising and accounting for the existing efforts of indigenous peoples, local communities and private actors. This can be achieved by supporting such areas in ways deemed appropriate by their custodians, including through the recognition of their rights and responsibilities (differentiated by gender where appropriate). A further opportunity lies in identifying, recognising and supporting OECMs across all governance types, with the consent of their custodians."
    2: "Effectiveness and efficiency (both spatial and economic) can be enhanced if new protected and conserved areas are designated with a focus on the network as a whole. This could equate to prioritising new designations that complement the existing network by enhancing connectivity, ecological representation, and/or coverage of areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem services."
    3: "It remains important to scale up conservation even in countries without large areas of intact biodiversity or other obvious candidates for protection. Efforts will be needed to identify suitable solutions in such countries, such as a focus on numerous small but well-connected protected and conserved areas, or achieving ecological representation though transboundary and regional cooperation. "
    4: "Consideration should be given to nationally-differentiated targets to optimise the global network of protected and conserved areas – by providing high levels of connectivity and ecological representation, and covering areas of importance for biodiversity – preceded by the identification of mechanisms to prevent the costs of conservation falling disproportionately on poorer economies or local people. "
    5: "Particular efforts are needed to expand marine protected and conserved areas beyond coastal waters, including in areas beyond national jurisdiction. "
    6: "The enabling conditions for effective management and equitable governance will be better understood if assessments are applied more widely and reported to the Protected Planet Initiative. Developing and operationalising meaningful global indicators would support these efforts and enable best practices to be scaled up. At site-level, assessments of effectiveness and equity can be used to improve governance and management over time. "
    7: "It is vital that protected and conserved areas achieve their conservation objectives, and/or sustain the positive conservation outcomes for which they have been recognised. Ongoing monitoring of outcomes at site-level would be beneficial, as would reporting of results to the Protected Planet Initiative to inform global indicators.  "
    8: "More integrated approaches to conservation and sustainable use can be developed if protected and conserved areas are mainstreamed across national policies and planning. "
    9: "The potential of protected and conserved areas to act as nature-based solutions to multiple socio-environmental challenges, including climate change, water security, and disaster risk management, thereby contributing to the implementation of several global conventions, should be recognised and enhanced.

    text: "The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Protected Planet Report 2020 (Álvarez Malvido <em>et al.</em>, 2021) assessed progress towards achieving the elements of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 in the region, using the July 2020 release of the WDPA.\n
          LAC has an extraordinary biological and cultural diversity and the region has made great efforts to increase protection coverage. In July 2020, 24% of the region’s terrestrial area, and 18.9% of its marine area, was within protected areas (see figure below), and coverage has increased even further in the months since then. These figures are based upon protected areas only, since no OECMs have yet been reported WD-OECM. However, several countries in the region are in the process of defining a roadmap for OECMs.\n
          Almost half of the countries and territories in the region have systematically assessed management effectiveness within their national systems of protected areas. The region also has high governance diversity, with non-government governance types, such as privately protected areas and ICCAs, having important potential as conservation mechanisms, although these are currently under-reported.\n
          Collaborative efforts are necessary to address regional challenges for protected and conserved areas in the post-2020 period. As in all regions, increasing protected and conserved area coverage must be accompanied by other actions to guarantee the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems services. These actions include adequate protection of KBAs and representativity of ecoregions, enhancing ecological connectivity, improving management effectiveness through systematic assessments, and establishing institutional and legal mechanisms to recognise and operationalise diverse governance arrangements. Protected and conserved areas must be supported by enabling conditions in order to fully implement their conservation goals."

    title: 'COVID-19: impacts on conservation areas and opportunities for change'
    authors: 'Mariana Napolitano Ferreira and Rachel Golden Kroner'

    text: "The effects of COVID-19 on human health and economies are evident in protected areas and OECMs around the world. In addition to negative impacts on effectiveness, management capacity and budgets, communities living in and around these areas have experienced significant impacts on their livelihoods (Hockings <em>et al.</em>, 2020). \n          
          Nearly half of PA agencies surveyed across 19 African countries reported that basic operations were at risk in the short term from the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 (Waithaka, 2020). The loss of income resulting from these restrictions significantly affected their ability to pay salaries, monitor and enforce protection for wildlife and protect local communities from damage caused by wildlife. The sudden collapse of tourism revenues in protected areas has caused job losses, undermined development projects, and weakened collaboration with investors (Waithaka, 2020).\n         
          Despite commitments around the world to “build back better”, the focus on short-term economic recovery risks putting pressure on environmental protections. One example relates to provisions authorising new or expanded extractive industries and infrastructure in protected and conserved areas (Conservation International, 2020). This is especially of concern in countries where these areas are already under severe pressure. However, protected and conserved areas have a central role in addressing ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and therefore reducing the risk of future zoonotic pandemics in addition to providing other economic, social and environmental benefits.\n
          Protected and conserved areas could therefore be a core component of economic stimulus packages (e.g. <a href='https://www.protectedplanet.net/news-and-stories/building-back-better-after-covid-19-pakistans-protected-areas-initiative' title='Visit a Protected Planet article on Pakistan's Protected Area Initiative' target='_blank'>Pakistan’s Protected Areas Initiative</a>; Khan, 2020). Support for protected and conserved areas in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the establishment of rapid response grants, support to local communities, and maintenance of essential services, must be followed by additional support in the medium to longer term, and actions for their implementation. These actions can include promoting the human-health benefits of protected and conserved areas, developing and expanding management capacities (e.g. provision of jobs for restoration, monitoring, and enforcement), and implementing strategies that ensure equitable governance and benefit-sharing. 2017).\n
          Recognising the benefits of protected and conserved areas, and supporting their effectiveness, will help countries rebuild after COVID-19 while simultaneously reducing the risk of future pandemics. Encouragingly, leaders from many global regions, including the European Union (European Council, 2020), Finland (Finnish Government, 2020), New Zealand (New Zealand Government, 2020), Pakistan (Khan, 2020), Iceland (OECD, 2020), Kenya (Kenyatta, 2020), and the United Kingdom (Lythgoe, 2020), have already signalled their intention to take advantage of this in their recovery plans. Other countries have the opportunity to do the same, supporting protected and conserved areas as part of a strategy to meet biodiversity, climate, and Sustainable Development Goals."
