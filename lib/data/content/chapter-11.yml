    "The past decade has seen marine protected area coverage increase by xx%, and terrestrial by xx%. The decade has also seen increases in connectivity, ecological representation and coverage of important areas for biodiversity. While it remains challenging to assess management effectiveness and equitable governance at the global level, assessments of both are being conducted more widely and methodologies are being refined. In the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook, Target 11 stood out as one of the few to have been partially achieved (CBD, 2020).  "

    "In 2020, the concept of protected and conserved areas is better understood than ever, as we close the decade with guidance on governance diversity (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2013), a host of best practice guidelines for protected and conserved areas (ref), a Green List standard to support effective governance and management, and a definition to guide the identification of OECMs (CBD, 2018). With better data (Bingham et al. 2019), new methodologies (protconn ref), and evolving and ever-improving technologies like remote sensing, we now have the means to monitor the world’s protected and conserved areas in ways that were near impossible in 2010.

    "Although this report has described several shortfalls in achieving Aichi Target 11, this should not be cause for despondency or a loss of momentum after 2020. It should be remembered that the Aichi Targets and the goals that will succeed them are a means to an end. That end is articulated in the CBD’s 2050 vision: "

  - "Achieving the 2050 vision will be challenging, but the governments of the world appear poised to take up this challenge through adopting the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, with its ambitious draft targets and focus on system-level conservation and sustainable use. Although the adoption of the Framework has been delayed, many governments and other actors are already promising more ambitious action on biodiversity loss (e.g. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.leaderspledgefornature.org\">Leaders' Pledge for Nature</a>)."
  - "No summary of the decade can be complete without an acknowledgement of the way it ended. COVID-19 has devastated lives, livelihoods and economies. It has forced us to recognise that biodiversity loss cannot continue. When governments adopt the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, they will do so with the knowledge that their commitments must be translated into action, and that halting biodiversity loss is no longer optional. The Protected Planet Report offers the following recommendations to support the implementation of the Framework:":
    1: "Protected and conserved area expansion can be achieved in part by recognising the existing efforts of indigenous peoples, local communities and private actors. These areas should be supported in ways deemed appropriate by their custodians, whose rights and responsibilities should be recognised. OECMs across all governance types should be identified, recognised and supported with the consent of their custodians.  "
    2: "New protected and conserved areas should be designated with a focus on the network as a whole: new designations should enhance connectivity, ecological representation, and coverage of areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Transboundary and regional cooperation should be scaled up.  "
    3: "Particular efforts are needed to expand marine protected and conserved areas beyond coastal waters, including in areas beyond national jurisdiction.  "
    4: "Assessments of effective and equitable governance and management should be widely applied. Global indicators should be developed, refined and operationalised.  "
    5: "The biodiversity outcomes of protected and conserved areas should be monitored. Global indicators should be developed, refined and operationalised.  "
    6: "Protected and conserved areas should be integrated across national policies and planning.  "
    7: "Data on all protected areas and OECMs should be reported to the Protected Planet Initiative with the consent of their custodians, reducing uncertainty (Box 14) in tracking progress towards the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.  "
