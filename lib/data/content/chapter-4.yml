subtitle: "Chapter four"
intro: "Protected area coverage of terrestrial ecoregions increased for 382 ecoregions between 2016 and 2018 and decreased for 148 ecoregions, resulting in 43.2% of ecoregions now meeting the 17% protection target on land (compared to 42.6 % in 2016). By contrast, significant progress has been made in the world’s oceans, with 45.7% of ecoregions meeting the 10% protection target in the ocean (compared to 36.2% in 2016). Protection of offshore oceans and freshwater ecoregions remains poor, or insufficiently documented."
achi_text_2: "43.2% of the 821 terrestrial ecoregions (excluding Antarctica, rock and ice) meet the target of at least 17% of their area included within protected areas, but 5.6% of ecoregions still have less than 1% protected area coverage, or no protection at all. 45.7% of the world’s 232 nearshore marine ecoregions have at least 10% of their area protected."
