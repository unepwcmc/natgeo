intro: "Protected area coverage of terrestrial ecoregions continues to increase globally. There are now 362 terrestrial ecoregions (44.0%) that meet the 17% protection target on land (compared to 42.6 % in 2016). Similarly, significant progress has been made in the world’s oceans, with 117 marine ecoregions (50.4%) meeting the 10% protection target in the ocean (compared to 36.2% in 2016). Protection of pelagic provinces and freshwater ecoregions remains poor, or insufficiently documented."
content_1: "44.0% of the 821 terrestrial ecoregions (excluding Antarctica, rock and ice) meet the target of at least 17% of their area included within protected areas, but 5.6% of ecoregions still have less than 1% protected area coverage, or no protection at all. As of 2019, over half (50.4%) of the world’s 232 nearshore marine ecoregions have at least 10% of their area protected. This is also true of marine realms (75%) and marine provinces (61.3%). Unfortunately, only 13.5% of pelagic provinces are meeting the 10% coverage target, as these areas are primarily in areas beyond national jurisdiction."

content_2: "Between 2016 and 2018, 382 terrestrial ecoregions saw their coverage increase and 148 terrestrial ecoregions saw their coverage decrease. Significant positive changes have taken place in the protection of marine ecoregions over the period 2016-2018, including in the high seas. There has also been a notable decrease in the number of marine ecoregions that have less than 1% protected area coverage. Yet, in 2018 24.3% of provinces still had less than 1% of their total area protected."

    title: 'Reflections on national processes to identify priorities for biodiversity conservation in Mexico.'
    authors: 'Andrew Rhodes'
    text: "Despite global and national efforts to implement effective strategies to halt biodiversity loss, drive sustainable development, and ensure resilient ecosystems and communities, much remains to be done. In developing strategies to address these challenges, countries often complement international standards (such as KBAs) with national priority-setting exercises. 
           For example, Mexico has spent decades developing multiple exercises to identify conservation priorities in the country. Coordinated by the National Commission for the Use and Knowledge of Biodiversity (CONABIO), the analysis of gaps and omissions in conservation was a conservation planning tool based on the evaluation of protected area networks and the identification of omissions in their ecosystem representation. The approach helped to identify areas of importance for biodiversity, as well as the processes and elements that maintain it.\n
           To evaluate the state of conservation in these important areas, and the effectiveness of those covered by protected areas, the National Biodiversity Monitoring System was launched in 2015. The System determines the condition of ecosystems in Mexico by estimating the degree of conservation through an indicator of terrestrial ecosystem integrity. An equivalent system for the marine environment is still needed.\n
           In 2020, a working group was established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, CONABIO, WRI and WWF. The group’s aim is to identify and analyze area-based conservation, restoration and sustainable use measures. It will also assess how these measures can support compliance with international commitments to be adopted as part of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. Like Mexico, countries must urgently move from an analysis of spatial priorities to comprehensive, multisectoral studies, to define effective area-based measures that contribute to halting the loss of nature and its ecosystem services."

    title: 'Areas of importance for ecosystem services: a forgotten element of Aichi Target 11'
    authors: 'Nigel Dudley'
    org: 'Equilibrium Research'
    text: "The importance of ecosystem services provided by protected and conserved areas are increasingly recognised,  including for their contributions to delivering the Sustainable Development Goals  through food and water security, disaster risk reduction, climate change mitigation and supporting human health. Yet although Aichi Target 11 highlights “...areas of particular importance to biodiversity and ecosystem services” (our emphasis) the latter have often been ignored in reporting progress against the target. This is not surprising. Despite numerous examples of ecosystem services from individual protected and conserved areas, global or national estimates of their contributions remain inadequate.\n 
          It is understandable that governments have faced challenges in implementing targets that are vague and unquantified. Attempts at measurement are either theoretical – relying heavily on potential values from genetic resources and similar that do not carry much political weight – or look at only a small range of benefits. We can make a good attempt at estimating carbon, in terms of both climate stabilisation and economic value,  although the latter relies on a notoriously volatile market. Water values can be calculated,  but most countries have no way of realising these values in economic terms, treating water security from natural ecosystems as a free and undervalued good. Disaster risk reduction services, such as natural ecosystems buffering against storms and floods, are huge but often only recognised when they disappear. \n          
          There is an urgent need for a clear, transparent way of capturing the economic and non-economic values of ecosystem services, at both national and site level, and developing a realistic target for what might be delivered from protected and conserved areas. The practical challenges of doing this are not to be under-estimated, but the demand is now ever more critical."
