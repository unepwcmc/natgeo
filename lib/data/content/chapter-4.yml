    "Systems of protected and conserved areas will not function effectively if they do not cover a representative sample of the world’s ecosystems and species. It is possible to assess ecological representation based on the proportion of species’ distributions covered by protected and conserved areas. However, coverage of ecoregions (ecological units of land, ocean or freshwater that share the same biological characteristics (Olson et al. 2001; Spalding et al. 2007 and 2012)) is more generally used to assess this element of Aichi Target 11 (Gannon et al. 2019). This is the metric used here."

    "Since 2012, the percentage of terrestrial ecoregions reaching the 17% target has increased by xx%. The improvement is even more pronounced in the marine realm, with an increase of xx%. Furthermore, the percentage of ecoregions entirely lacking protection (less than 1% coverage by protected areas) has decreased from xx% to xx%."

content_2: "However, if Aichi Target 11’s coverage goals are assumed to apply to ecoregions, many remain under-protected. The proportion of terrestrial ecoregions with at least 17% protected area coverage is only 44.0% (362 ecoregions (rising to xxx when OECMs are factored in)). Among marine ecoregions and pelagic provinces, the proportion with at least 10% coverage by protected areas is 50.4% (117 ecoregions (rising to xxx when OECMs are factored in)). This figure increases to 61.3% when considering only nearshore marine ecoregions. It drops to 13.5% in pelagic provinces, which fall largely outside national jurisdiction. Methodologies and datasets for assessing coverage of freshwater ecoregions vary, but studies agree they are less than 25% protected in total (refs).  "

content_3: "There remains a clear need to improve ecoregion representation, and attention is particularly needed in ecoregions that lack protection entirely, such as the Angolan montane forest-grassland mosaic ecoregion, South China Sea Islands ecoregion, and Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests ecoregion. Two options for increasing ecological representation include greater use of systematic conservation planning (Box 7) and consideration of nationally-differentiated targets (Box 8)."

    title: 'Systematic Conservation Planning'
    authors: 'Javier Fajardo and Andy Arnell'
    org: 'UNEP-WCMC'
    text: "Systematic approaches to conservation planning (Margules & Pressey 2000) have been developed over the last three decades to provide decision support to efficiently meet conservation goals, including by ensuring that conservation networks are representative of species and ecosystems. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) typically uses spatial analysis and selection algorithms to prioritise areas for protection, thereby maximising positive outcomes for biodiversity while minimising economic and societal costs. \n
           The approach is based on clearly stated underlying principles and target-setting, promoting transparency and accountability in decision making. Crucially, SCP should be used alongside consultations with local people and other stakeholders to identify where and how conservation efforts should be scaled up – either by establishing new protected and conserved areas, or by providing increased support to measures not previously considered part of the formal conservation network. \n
            Since its inception, SCP has been embraced by large conservation organisations and governments, providing decision support for the design and improvement of protected area networks worldwide (McIntosh et al. 2017). Examples of success span from the recent declaration of Tun Mustapha Park in Malaysia following a SCP process (Jumin et al. 2018) to the zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia (Fernandes et al. 2005) and plans for the conservation network in South Africa (Knight et al. 2006). Together with solving problems such as the smarter consideration of OECMs in addition to protected areas, or finding imaginative solutions to account for climate change, SCP is regarded as a key tool to achieve a future where humans and nature thrive together."

    title: 'Global conservation area targets will be most efficiently met through differentiated responsibilities at the country level'
    authors: 'Xiaoli Shen'
    text: "Countries are encouraged by CBD to adapt conservation area targets to national conditions (CBD, 2010). However, a uniform conservation target – with each country adopting the same percentage coverage target as the global target – has often been accepted by contracting parties under previous conservation frameworks. Given that biodiversity is unevenly distributed across the planet and accounting for a wide variety of national contexts, a more efficient approach to protecting global biodiversity would be for countries to adopt differentiated conservation targets while the total global coverage target remains the same.\n
          This approach was explored in a recent study [insert study], which generated spatial prioritisations using the 30% and 50% conservation targets proposed in the build-up to the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD, 2020). These spatial prioritizations aimed to maximize the conservation of species diversity and carbon, ensure representativeness among ecoregions and minimize the total cost of the solution. The findings suggested that allowing different percentage targets for different countries, adding up to a global target (i.e., 30% or 50%), would conserve far more terrestrial vertebrate species and carbon stocks than setting uniform targets for all countries. However, the largely varied conservation targets among countries (nearly 100% of some countries’ land mass) and heavier conservation burdens for economically-poorer countries indicate substantial (and in some cases insurmountable) challenges for countries to achieve these conservation targets. \n
          If some of these challenges could be addressed, then the different targets identified could serve as the basis for countries to develop nationally-appropriate targets (which might vary depending on whether biodiversity, ecosystem services, or other values are prioritised). Approaches to mobilize transformative change (e.g. the Three Global Conditions, Locke et al. 2019), and mechanisms to ensure fair sharing of conservation burdens among countries, would be needed to support countries with high conservation targets."

Countries with a terrestrial area < 18,000 km2 are excluded.'
