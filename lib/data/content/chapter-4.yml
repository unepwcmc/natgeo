    "Systems of protected and conserved areas will not function effectively if they do not cover a representative sample of the world’s ecosystems and species. It is possible to assess ecological representation based on the proportion of species’ distributions covered by protected and conserved areas. However, coverage of ecoregions (ecological units of land, ocean or freshwater that share the same biological characteristics (Olson et al. 2001; Spalding et al. 2007 and 2012)) is more generally used to assess this element of Aichi Target 11 (Gannon et al. 2019). This is the metric used here."

    "Since 2012, the percentage of terrestrial ecoregions reaching the 17% target has increased by xx%. The improvement is even more pronounced in the marine realm, with an increase of xx%. Furthermore, the percentage of ecoregions entirely lacking protection (less than 1% coverage by protected areas) has decreased from xx% to xx%."

content_2: "However, if Aichi Target 11’s coverage goals are assumed to apply to ecoregions, many remain under-protected. The proportion of terrestrial ecoregions with at least 17% protected area coverage is only 44.0% (362 ecoregions (rising to xxx when OECMs are factored in)). Among marine ecoregions and pelagic provinces, the proportion with at least 10% coverage by protected areas is 50.4% (117 ecoregions (rising to xxx when OECMs are factored in)). This figure increases to 61.3% when considering only nearshore marine ecoregions. It drops to 13.5% in pelagic provinces, which fall largely outside national jurisdiction. Methodologies and datasets for assessing coverage of freshwater ecoregions vary, but studies agree they are less than 25% protected in total (refs).  "

Two options for increasing ecological representation include greater use of systematic conservation planning (Box 7) and consideration of nationally-differentiated targets (Box 8)."

    title: 'Reflections on national processes to identify priorities for biodiversity conservation in Mexico.'
    authors: 'Andrew Rhodes'
    text: "Despite global and national efforts to implement effective strategies to halt biodiversity loss, drive sustainable development, and ensure resilient ecosystems and communities, much remains to be done. In developing strategies to address these challenges, countries often complement international standards (such as KBAs) with national priority-setting exercises. 
           For example, Mexico has spent decades developing multiple exercises to identify conservation priorities in the country. Coordinated by the National Commission for the Use and Knowledge of Biodiversity (CONABIO), the analysis of gaps and omissions in conservation was a conservation planning tool based on the evaluation of protected area networks and the identification of omissions in their ecosystem representation. The approach helped to identify areas of importance for biodiversity, as well as the processes and elements that maintain it.\n
           To evaluate the state of conservation in these important areas, and the effectiveness of those covered by protected areas, the National Biodiversity Monitoring System was launched in 2015. The System determines the condition of ecosystems in Mexico by estimating the degree of conservation through an indicator of terrestrial ecosystem integrity. An equivalent system for the marine environment is still needed.\n
           In 2020, a working group was established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, CONABIO, WRI and WWF. The group’s aim is to identify and analyze area-based conservation, restoration and sustainable use measures. It will also assess how these measures can support compliance with international commitments to be adopted as part of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. Like Mexico, countries must urgently move from an analysis of spatial priorities to comprehensive, multisectoral studies, to define effective area-based measures that contribute to halting the loss of nature and its ecosystem services."

    title: 'Areas of importance for ecosystem services: a forgotten element of Aichi Target 11'
    authors: 'Nigel Dudley'
    org: 'Equilibrium Research'
    text: "The importance of ecosystem services provided by protected and conserved areas are increasingly recognised,  including for their contributions to delivering the Sustainable Development Goals  through food and water security, disaster risk reduction, climate change mitigation and supporting human health. Yet although Aichi Target 11 highlights “...areas of particular importance to biodiversity and ecosystem services” (our emphasis) the latter have often been ignored in reporting progress against the target. This is not surprising. Despite numerous examples of ecosystem services from individual protected and conserved areas, global or national estimates of their contributions remain inadequate.\n 
          It is understandable that governments have faced challenges in implementing targets that are vague and unquantified. Attempts at measurement are either theoretical – relying heavily on potential values from genetic resources and similar that do not carry much political weight – or look at only a small range of benefits. We can make a good attempt at estimating carbon, in terms of both climate stabilisation and economic value,  although the latter relies on a notoriously volatile market. Water values can be calculated,  but most countries have no way of realising these values in economic terms, treating water security from natural ecosystems as a free and undervalued good. Disaster risk reduction services, such as natural ecosystems buffering against storms and floods, are huge but often only recognised when they disappear. \n          
          There is an urgent need for a clear, transparent way of capturing the economic and non-economic values of ecosystem services, at both national and site level, and developing a realistic target for what might be delivered from protected and conserved areas. The practical challenges of doing this are not to be under-estimated, but the demand is now ever more critical."
