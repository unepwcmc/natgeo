subtitle: "Chapter 4"
intro: "Protected area coverage of terrestrial ecoregions increased for 382 ecoregions between 2016 and 2018 and decreased for 148 ecoregions, resulting in 43.2% of ecoregions now meeting the 17% protection target on land (compared to 42.6 % in 2016). By contrast, significant progress has been made in the world’s oceans, with 45.7% of ecoregions meeting the 10% protection target in the ocean (compared to 36.2% in 2016). Protection of offshore oceans and freshwater ecoregions remains poor, or insufficiently documented."
content_1: "43.2% of the 821 terrestrial ecoregions (excluding Antarctica, rock and ice) meet the target of at least 17% of their area included within protected areas, but 5.6% of ecoregions still have less than 1% protected area coverage, or no protection at all. 45.7% of the world’s 232 nearshore marine ecoregions have at least 10% of their area protected."

content_2: "Compared to 2016, 382 terrestrial ecoregions have seen their coverage increase and 148 terrestrial ecoregions have seen their coverage decrease. Significant positive changes have taken place in the protection of marine ecoregions over the period 2016-2018, including in the high seas. There has also been a notable decrease in the number of marine ecoregions that have less than 1% protected area coverage. Yet, 24.3% of provinces still have less than 1% of their total area protected."
