    "This report has so far focused on the location and coverage of protected and conserved areas. Of equal importance is the quality of governance and management within these areas. Despite an increase in global protected area coverage, biodiversity continues to decline, even within some protected areas. This highlights the need for effective management, which is the focus of this section.  "

    "The effective management of protected areas is embedded in Aichi Target 11, but assessing whether this element of the target has been achieved is complex. It requires consideration of multiple aspects such as design and planning, management processes, outputs and biodiversity outcomes. Several methodologies have been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of protected area management. These vary in scope and content. Most rely on self-assessment and are best suited to understanding the effectiveness of management in a specific site at a given point in time. Such assessments are less well-suited to comparisons of management effectiveness between sites, limiting the extent to which they can be aggregated into global indicators.  "

    "The management effectiveness indicator for Aichi Target 11 tracks the percentage of protected areas that have undergone management effectiveness assessments (with a target of 60% of total area). The Global Database on Protected Area Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME) is used to calculate this indicator.  "
  -
    "The GD-PAME stores assessments from xx countries, conducted using xx different methodologies. In total, xx% of protected areas in the WDPA have been assessed. Xx% of countries have met the target of assessing management effectiveness across 60% of their protected lands and waters. Globally, there is a shortfall of xx%."

    "The clear limitation of this indicator is that it does not reveal how effectively the world’s protected areas are managed; it simply tells us where assessments have been carried out. Efforts to develop a more meaningful global measure of effectiveness have been hindered by a number of challenges: many countries do not have established mechanisms, or sufficient resources and capacity, to report information; willingness to report can be limited by political sensitivities (e.g. a concern that poor performance will result in the withdrawal of funding); and it is challenging to develop methodologies that are suitable for global-level reporting while also being flexible enough to adapt to local conditions and capacities. Natural World Heritage Sites are one group of protected areas for which results are available. The finding that fewer than half of these sites have effective protection and management (Osipova et al., 2017) is troubling, and reinforces the need for transparent reporting across all protected areas."

    "The IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas has an important role to play as the global standard for effective and equitable governance and management (IUCN and WCPA, 2017). Beyond providing a standard for management effectiveness, the Green List links management to governance and successful conservation outcomes – elements that have been lacking from indicators on the effectiveness of the world’s conservation network. As the number of jurisdictions and sites committed to applying the IUCN Green List Standard increases, it may become a powerful tool to assess protected area performance, including quality metrics, into the future. Box 9 further considers the evolution of management effectiveness assessments.  "

    text: "Effectiveness needs to start from the ground up, ensuring sites are in the places most needing conservation management, that they are subject to good governance and that they deliver their goals effectively. Many tools have been developed, and adapted, for site-based management effectiveness assessments; descriptions of these tools, and details of the many thousands of sites that have used them, can be found on Protected Planet’s GD-PAME pages. What has proved difficult however is taking these site- or sometimes system-based assessments and extracting one or two indicators for global effectiveness reporting. One problem has been a confusion in what is being reported; while site-level assessments are more focussed on management, the demand at the global level has often been for data on conservation outcomes. Most PAME methodologies cannot deliver this, and often explicitly state that outcome monitoring needs other tools, systems and processes to complement management effectiveness assessment. \n
           There is an opportunity for the post-2020 effectiveness indicators to address this disparity in global and site-level expectations of effectiveness assessments, in addition to providing clarity on both the criteria and the method of reporting. One option for globally consistent indicators is to build on the advances made in remote sensing and other technologies. Appropriate resolution in time and space, data quality, and open access will be important, as will data validation. Such global indicators still need to be complemented by site-level indicators. These should focus on the condition of the biodiversity elements for which the site is valued and be based on finer-scale biodiversity inventories and capture details of change that more coarse-scale remote sensed measures cannot (Maxwell et al, 2020)."
