title: "Equitably Managed"
subtitle: "Chapter six"
intro: "The equitable management of protected areas is a key aspect of Aichi Target 11. A framework for understanding equity in protected areas has been developed, and several methodologies have been proposed to enable the assessment of equitable management in all its dimensions. Despite these advances, assessments have been implemented in only a limited number of protected areas, and conclusions cannot yet be drawn on a broad scale. Addressing this lack of assessment at system and site scales is a priority leading up to 2020 and beyond."

column_chart_intro: "The diversity of governance types for protected areas in any national system provides an indication of the recognition of the diverse actors involved in these conservation efforts, although it does not itself inform an understanding of whether this is good governance or equitable management."
