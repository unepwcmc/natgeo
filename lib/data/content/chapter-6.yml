    "This report has so far focused on the location and coverage of protected and conserved areas. Of equal importance is the quality of governance and management within these areas. Despite an increase in global protected area coverage, biodiversity continues to decline, even within some protected areas. This highlights the need for effective management, which is the focus of this section.  "

    "The effective management of protected areas is embedded in Aichi Target 11, but assessing whether this element of the target has been achieved is complex. It requires consideration of multiple aspects such as design and planning, management processes, outputs and biodiversity outcomes. Several methodologies have been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of protected area management. These vary in scope and content. Most rely on self-assessment and are best suited to understanding the effectiveness of management in a specific site at a given point in time. Such assessments are less well-suited to comparisons of management effectiveness between sites, limiting the extent to which they can be aggregated into global indicators.  "

    "The management effectiveness indicator for Aichi Target 11 tracks the percentage of protected areas that have undergone management effectiveness assessments (with a target of 60% of total area). The Global Database on Protected Area Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME) is used to calculate this indicator.  "
  -
    "The GD-PAME stores assessments from xx countries, conducted using xx different methodologies. In total, xx% of protected areas in the WDPA have been assessed. Xx% of countries have met the target of assessing management effectiveness across 60% of their protected lands and waters. Globally, there is a shortfall of xx%."

    "The clear limitation of this indicator is that it does not reveal how effectively the world’s protected areas are managed; it simply tells us where assessments have been carried out. Efforts to develop a more meaningful global measure of effectiveness have been hindered by a number of challenges: many countries do not have established mechanisms, or sufficient resources and capacity, to report information; willingness to report can be limited by political sensitivities (e.g. a concern that poor performance will result in the withdrawal of funding); and it is challenging to develop methodologies that are suitable for global-level reporting while also being flexible enough to adapt to local conditions and capacities. Natural World Heritage Sites are one group of protected areas for which results are available. The finding that fewer than half of these sites have effective protection and management (Osipova et al., 2017) is troubling, and reinforces the need for transparent reporting across all protected areas."

    "The IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas has an important role to play as the global standard for effective and equitable governance and management (IUCN and WCPA, 2017). Beyond providing a standard for management effectiveness, the Green List links management to governance and successful conservation outcomes – elements that have been lacking from indicators on the effectiveness of the world’s conservation network. As the number of jurisdictions and sites committed to applying the IUCN Green List Standard increases, it may become a powerful tool to assess protected area performance, including quality metrics, into the future. Box 9 further considers the evolution of management effectiveness assessments.  "

    title: 'Governance assessments in Territories of Life'
    authors: 'Jennifer Kelleher - Programme Lead, Governance, Equity & Rights, Global Protected Areas Programme, IUCN, Dr. Stephen Nindi - Director General National Land Use Planning Commission (NLUPC) Tanzania. '
    text: "The IUCN approaches equity through the lens of governance; a concept that is concerned with decision making in protected and conserved areas – who has been making decisions? How have those decisions been made and who has participated? The IUCN distinguishes four main types of governance in protected and conserves areas: A. government B. shared; C. private; and D. “territories and areas conserved by indigenous peoples and local communities” or “territories of life” (also referred to as ICCAs).\n
           Issues relating to governance were examined during a series of national dialogues held during 2017-2019, one of which was convened in Tanzania by the Global Protected Areas Programme of IUCN, together with Tanzanian authorities, traditional knowledge holders and other experts. The process revealed Tanzania as one of the richest countries on Earth with regard to its biodiversity and its governance diversity. The system of PAs includes Africa’s highest peak and four natural World Heritage Sites: Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Kilimanjaro National Park, Selous Game Reserve (now Nyerere National Park) and Serengeti National Park. It also includes shared governance models such as Wildlife Management Areas, Village Forests and Game Reserves, alongside areas conserved under Certificates of Customary Right of Occupancy (CCROs). \n
           Governance diversity has positive implications for people and nature in Tanzania, with areas under the traditional governance, management and custodianship of indigenous peoples and local communities demonstrating long-term conservation effectiveness. Traditional institutions for landscape conservation in the Matengo Highlands illustrate how traditional knowledge under the customary Sengu system can achieve both sustainable livelihoods and conservation of the landscape. The Sengu system manages the sustainability of the steep slopes of the Ntambo landholding through traditional cultivation systems known as ngolo (four-tiered ridges). This system has its governance structure formalized in the Tanzanian regulatory framework, revealing an impressive rooting of conservation in both traditional and modern national cultural identities. Examples such as this can be of rich value to the world, demonstrating how good governance, and recognition of diverse governance types, can contribute to successful systems of protected and conserved areas."
