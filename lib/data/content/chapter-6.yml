subtitle: "Chapter 6"
intro: "The equitable management of protected areas is a key aspect of Aichi Target 11. A framework for understanding equity in protected areas has been developed, and several methodologies have been proposed to enable the assessment of equitable management in all its dimensions. Despite these advances, assessments have been implemented in only a limited number of protected areas, and conclusions cannot yet be drawn on a broad scale. Addressing this lack of assessment at system and site scales is a priority leading up to 2020 and beyond."

content_2: "The diversity of governance types of protected areas provides an indication of the recognition of the diverse actors involved in these conservation efforts, although it does not itself inform an understanding of whether this is good governance or equitable management. Protected areas under all IUCN governance types can be reported to the WDPA, but non-government types are currently under-reported, with 82% of recorded protected areas managed by government agencies."

    title: 'Governance assessments in Territories of Life'
    authors: 'Jennifer Kelleher - Programme Lead, Governance, Equity & Rights, Global Protected Areas Programme, IUCN, Dr. Stephen Nindi - Director General National Land Use Planning Commission (NLUPC) Tanzania. '
    text: "The IUCN approaches equity through the lens of governance; a concept that is concerned with decision making in protected and conserved areas – who has been making decisions? How have those decisions been made and who has participated? The IUCN distinguishes four main types of governance in protected and conserves areas: A. government B. shared; C. private; and D. “territories and areas conserved by indigenous peoples and local communities” or “territories of life” (also referred to as ICCAs).\n
           Issues relating to governance were examined during a series of national dialogues held during 2017-2019, one of which was convened in Tanzania by the Global Protected Areas Programme of IUCN, together with Tanzanian authorities, traditional knowledge holders and other experts. The process revealed Tanzania as one of the richest countries on Earth with regard to its biodiversity and its governance diversity. The system of PAs includes Africa’s highest peak and four natural World Heritage Sites: Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Kilimanjaro National Park, Selous Game Reserve (now Nyerere National Park) and Serengeti National Park. It also includes shared governance models such as Wildlife Management Areas, Village Forests and Game Reserves, alongside areas conserved under Certificates of Customary Right of Occupancy (CCROs). \n
           Governance diversity has positive implications for people and nature in Tanzania, with areas under the traditional governance, management and custodianship of indigenous peoples and local communities demonstrating long-term conservation effectiveness. Traditional institutions for landscape conservation in the Matengo Highlands illustrate how traditional knowledge under the customary Sengu system can achieve both sustainable livelihoods and conservation of the landscape. The Sengu system manages the sustainability of the steep slopes of the Ntambo landholding through traditional cultivation systems known as ngolo (four-tiered ridges). This system has its governance structure formalized in the Tanzanian regulatory framework, revealing an impressive rooting of conservation in both traditional and modern national cultural identities. Examples such as this can be of rich value to the world, demonstrating how good governance, and recognition of diverse governance types, can contribute to successful systems of protected and conserved areas."
