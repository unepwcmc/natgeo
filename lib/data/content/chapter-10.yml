    "2020 marked the end of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (2011-2020), but also the closing of the decade that introduced the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals: the strongest statement to date from the world’s governments that they see development and conservation as intrinsically linked. The past ten years have seen the rise of novel ideas about area-based conservation, and debates have intensified around the role of protected and conserved areas post-2020. While some discussions have focused on the proportion of the world that must be protected or conserved to halt biodiversity loss, others have been driven by a sense that more systemic change is needed (Bhola et al. 2020). At the same time, methods of modelling future scenarios have evolved to give us a clearer picture of how human, climate and biodiversity concerns can be intertwined to ‘bend the curve’ of biodiversity loss (WWF, 2020; Leclère et al., 2020; CBD, 2020).  "

    "Against the backdrop of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, these developments have been motivated by  growing evidence that protected areas are not always well managed or reaching the biodiversity most in need of protection (Geldmann et. al 2019; Watson et al. 2014). Although Aichi Target 11’s percentage coverage elements are measurable and have incentivised national action (Woodley et al., 2019), increases in coverage alone will not save biodiversity. After 2020, the quality of systems of protected and conserved areas must be the focus. "

    "In the context of governance, quality is linked to diversity (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2013. Although governance diversity has received greater attention in recent years, there is more to be done. Evidence is mounting that indigenous peoples and local communities occupy many of the world’s remaining intact ecosystems (refs; Garnett et al., 2018; Fa et al., 2020; WWF; ICCA Consortium), while often lacking formal rights to lands, waters and resources. Stronger partnerships between indigenous peoples, local communities, governments, conservation NGOs and rights-based NGOs will help to articulate how indigenous peoples and local communities can best be recognised and supported in their conservation efforts, with due consideration for their rights, livelihoods and development aspirations.  "

    "It has been similarly documented that private actors often lack recognition for their role in conservation (Bingham et al. 2017), with only xx countries and territories reporting privately protected areas to the WDPA (forthcoming ref). The achievement of the CBD’s 2050 vision will therefore depend partially on recognising and documenting actions that are already ongoing, and supporting those responsible to maintain positive outcomes in the long term. Beyond non-state protected areas, this requires a vast, collaborative effort to identify, recognise and document OECMs.  "

    "The recognition of existing measures must not be the only approach, however, since fully documenting such measures will not alter the fact that biodiversity continues to decline (WWF 2020; IPBES 2019). There remains a need to increase coverage through the designation of new protected and conserved areas, and it is imperative that this is accompanied by a greater emphasis on integrated sustainable use and conservation, on ecological systems and connectedness, and on networks that encompass a representative sample of all elements of biodiversity (e.g. Ceballos 2015; Watson et al. 2020). These networks of protected and conserved areas will need effective management, adequate resourcing, and equitable governance – including through the participation of women and other marginalised groups. Monitoring at the local and global level will be essential, including of aspects that are currently challenging, such as equitable governance and marine connectivity. Finally, monitoring of biodiversity outcomes in protected areas has not received due attention over the past ten years. Beyond 2020, it is vital that we improve our ability to monitor such outcomes (Geldmann et al. 2019), learn from challenges, and scale up examples of success. "
