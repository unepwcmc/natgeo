subtitle: "Chapter 2"
intro: "There has been good progress in expanding the coverage of both terrestrial and marine protected areas, with terrestrial coverage slightly increasing from 14.7% in 2016 to 14.9% in 2018, and marine coverage increasing faster from 10.2% to 16.8% in national waters. With concerted efforts from governments to implement national commitments, both terrestrial and marine coverage targets are likely to be achieved by 2020, although further areas will be needed for a full representation of areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services."

content: "There are currently XXX designated protected areas recorded in the WDPA. Terrestrial protected areas protect just over XXX million km2, equivalent to XXX% of the earth’s land surface. Marine protected areas cover XXX million km2, representing XXX% of the world’s oceans. However, marine areas under national jurisdiction (Exclusive Economic Zones or EEZ) have significantly more protection (XXX%) than Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) (XXX%)."

area_chart_1_description: "On average, coverage of marine protected areas continues to increase rapidly since 2016, whilst the growth in terrestrial protection has largely tapered off. The extent of protected area coverage is highly variable between countries in both land and ocean. Information on future commitments collected by the CBD Secretariat suggests that with concerted efforts from governments, coverage of protected areas will increase significantly over the next two years."
