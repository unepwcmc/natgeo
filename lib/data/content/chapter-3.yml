intro: "Despite concerted global efforts and significant progress, the absolute targets to conserve 17% of land and inland water areas, and 10% of coastal and marine areas, have not yet been met. As of December 2020, XX km2 (x%) of land and inland water ecosystems, and XX km2 (x%) of coastal waters and the ocean, are within protected areas and OECMs. Despite the shortfalls, major gains in coverage have been made over the past decade, particularly in coastal waters and the oceans."

    "The WDPA has been the key tool for assessing the area covered by protected areas, and progress towards achieving Aichi Target 11, over the last decade (refs: IPBES, GEO, GBO). In the first Protected Planet Report in 2012, and in every report since, the narrative has been one of growth (refs: PP 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018). Since 2012, an additional XXX km2 of land and inland water ecosystems, and XXX km2 of coastal waters and the ocean, has been placed within protected areas. These figures, however, do not tell the entire story (Box 3) and omit many non-state protected areas (Box 4). Factoring in the limited available data on OECMs adds a further xx km2 on land and xx km2 in coastal waters and the ocean."

    "Despite this progress, neither of Aichi Target 11’s coverage goals (17% of land and inland water ecosystems and 10% of coastal waters and the ocean) were met by the close of 2020, with coverage now at xx% and xx% respectively. The same is true of Sustainable Development Goal 14.5, which also concluded in 2020 and shares the 10% target. Marine coverage can be further broken down into national waters and areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), painting a more complex picture. While great successes have been observed within national jurisdiction, where protected areas and OECMs now cover xx%, ABNJ lags behind at xx%."

content_2: "In spite of the shortfalls, much has been achieved over the past ten years, most notably in the marine realm. In recent years, terrestrial growth has been outpaced by growth in coastal waters and the oceans by [orders of magnitude?], thanks in large part to the designation of very large marine protected areas. This trend appears likely to continue into the next decade, with a further xxx km2 planned for protection at the start of 2020, spanning just x proposed marine protected areas. In comparison, since the publication of the 2012 report, terrestrial protected areas have expanded by XXX km2. "
content_3: "The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is likely to go further than the 2020 targets by proposing a coverage goal of 30%. The continued expansion of protected and conserved areas (both through new designations and through the recognition of existing measures) will be imperative to achieving the ambitious goals of the Framework and the CBD’s 2050 vision. However, it is also essential to consider the quality elements beyond coverage, in order to ensure that systems of protected and conserved areas are effective and achieve real conservation outcomes. These elements are discussed in the following sections.  "

area_charts_description: "On average, coverage of marine protected areas continues to increase rapidly since 2016, whilst the growth in terrestrial protection has largely tapered off. The extent of protected area coverage is highly variable between countries in both land and ocean. Information on future commitments collected by the CBD Secretariat suggests that with concerted efforts from governments, coverage of protected areas will increase significantly over the next two years."

    text: "Legal changes that temper restrictions, shrink boundaries, or eliminate protected areas – protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) events – are widespread (1, 2). Although many countries have succeeded in expanding and improving their protected area networks, global coverage figures showing net growth obscure information about PADDD (3, 4), including its extent, patterns, trends, proximate causes, and impacts.\n
           Between 1892 and 2018, governments in 73 countries enacted 4,229 PADDD events, affecting more than 2.2 million km2 in 3,519 protected areas (4-8). Although global figures represent a conservative estimate, in countries where systematic research has been conducted, on average 18% of protected areas have been affected by enacted PADDD events. Downsizings and degazettements reduced net protected area coverage in the United States of America, China, and likely elsewhere (5, 9) and prevented three countries from reaching 17% terrestrial protected area coverage by 2020 (10). \n
           Although proximate causes vary, 61% of enacted PADDD events were related to industrial-scale natural resource extraction and development. A smaller subset of PADDD events were related to local pressures and land claims (28%), and conservation planning (1.6%). The majority (78%) of events were enacted since the year 2000. Notably, 24% were later reversed, and 5% were offset by compensatory protected area expansions or upgrades.\n
           Known ecological impacts of PADDD include accelerated deforestation, increased carbon emissions, and habitat fragmentation (11, 12). The growing scientific literature on PADDD demonstrates the need for comprehensive monitoring, rigorous analyses, and holistic policies that recognize the impermanence of some conservation initiatives."

    title: 'Lessons from Oceania on the benefits of governance diversity'

    text: "A growing body of evidence suggests that sustainable interactions of humans and biodiversity, often following customary law and traditional knowledge, are effective for reaching biodiversity goals (IPBES, 2018). \n 
          In Oceania, a large proportion of land falls under customary ownership, and diverse systems of traditional governance maintain a strong influence over natural resource management (SPREP, 2016). These traditional governance systems empower local communities and provide insight into how various management approaches and area-based tools can be mutually applied to govern a common resource (Vierros et al., 2020). Govan (2015) identifies that these systems encourage rights-based site-specific management approaches that apply a wide range of management tools, complementing the access control measures typical of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). \n          
          Although most protected and conserved areas in Oceania are territories and areas conserved by indigenous peoples and local communities (ICCAs), many in this category are not legally recognised and/or have not been formally registered with their respective national governments. Govan & Jupiter (2013) identify that this may be due to community perceptions that doing so “could lessen their autonomy and rights over customary lands”. This has contributed to global under-reporting of ICCAs, with the implication that ICCAs are not adequately captured in the WDPA, WD-OECM and ICCA Registry. Privately protected areas and OECMs are similarly under-reported. This situation, if left unaddressed, will continue to impede the accuracy of coverage statistics and associated analyses, especially as the world prepares to adopt new conservation targets in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework."
