intro: "Since 2010, over 21 million km<sup>2</sup> has been placed within protected and conserved areas, meaning that 42% of the area now within protected and conserved areas has been added in the last decade. As a result, the May 2021 WDPA and WD-OECM show that at least 22.5 million km<sup>2</sup> (16.64%) of land and inland water ecosystems, and 28.1 million km<sup>2</sup> (7.74%) of coastal waters and the ocean, are within protected areas and OECMs. It is expected that the percentage targets would be met or exceeded, at least on land, if OECMs and non-state protected areas were comprehensively mapped."
blockquote_text: "Based on the available data in the WDPA and WD-OECM, and considering the known limitations of the databases, it is likely that the 17% coverage target for land and inland waters has been significantly exceeded in reality."

    "The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) has been the key tool for assessing the area covered by protected areas, and progress towards achieving Aichi Target 11, over the last decade (IPBES, 2019; UNEP, 2019; CBD, 2020). In the first Protected Planet Report in 2012, and in every report since, the narrative has been one of growth (Bertzky <span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2012; Juffe-Bignoli <span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2014; UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2016; UNEP-WCMC <span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2018). Since 2010, an additional 2.1 million km<sup>2</sup> of land and inland water ecosystems, and 18.8 million km<sup>2</sup> of coastal waters and the ocean, has been placed within protected areas (however, as discussed in Box 3, these figures do not tell the entire story). Although few countries have reported on OECMs at the time of publication, those that have been reported already add 1.3 million km<sup>2</sup> on land and over 300,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the ocean. At the national level, 82% of countries and territories have succeeded in increasing their protected area and OECM coverage."

    "While the coverage figure derived from the data currently stands at 16.64%, a delay in reporting means that some protected areas designated in 2020 will not be reflected in the WDPA when this report is published. Many of these sites are likely to be added to the WDPA during 2021, and readers should therefore consult <a href='https://www.protectedplanet.net/en'>www.protectedplanet.net</a> for the most up to date coverage statistics. Perhaps more importantly, it is likely that the appropriate recognition and reporting of existing non-state protected areas (Box 4) and OECMs would significantly increase coverage."
  -
    "There has also been significant increase in the extent of marine protected areas over the last 10 years. However, the data do not yet show that Aichi Target 11’s 10% coverage target has been met, and the same is true of Sustainable Development Goal 14.5, which also concluded in 2020 and shares the 10% target. Coverage based on the WDPA and WD-OECM stands at 7.74%. However, several large sites are known to be in the pipeline, including some that might have been designated in 2020 had COVID-19 not delayed key meetings (e.g. OSPAR Commission, 2020). As with the terrestrial realm, non-state protected areas and OECMs in coastal and marine areas would undoubtedly increase coverage if they were mapped and appropriately recognised."
  -
    "Marine coverage can be further broken down into national waters and areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), painting a more complex picture. While significant expansions in coverage have been observed within national jurisdiction, where protected areas and OECMs now cover 18.01%, ABNJ lags behind at 1.18%."

    "Although new data on OECMs have significantly increased terrestrial coverage since 2019, growth in terrestrial protected areas has been outpaced in recent years by growth in protection of coastal waters and the oceans. This is thanks in large part to the designation of growing numbers of very large marine protected areas. This trend appears likely to continue into the next decade, with a further 8.8 million km<sup>2</sup> committed or otherwise planned for protection at the start of 2021, from just five proposed marine protected areas."

    "The post-2020 global biodiversity framework is anticipated to incorporate a more ambitious coverage target on protected and conserved areas than Aichi Target 11, alongside quality elements. A focus on such elements will be essential to ensuring that systems of protected and conserved areas achieve real conservation outcomes. These elements are discussed in the following sections. "

    title: 'Global figures showing net increases in protected area coverage obscure legal rollbacks'

    text: "<blockquote>Impermanence of protected areas is more widespread than previously recognized, necessitating proactive and holistic policy responses to foster more durable conservation</blockquote>

    Legal changes that temper restrictions, change boundaries, or eliminate protected areas – protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) events – are widespread (Mascia and Pailler, 2011). Although many countries have succeeded in expanding and improving their protected area networks, global coverage figures showing net growth obscure information about PADDD (Lewis <span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2019; Golden Kroner <span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2019), including its extent, patterns, trends, proximate causes, and impacts.

    Between 1892 and 2020, governments in at least 74 countries enacted 4,399 PADDD events, affecting more than 3.14 million km<sup>2</sup> in 3,670 protected areas (Golden Kroner<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2019; Ma<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2019; De Vos<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2019; Dorji<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2019; Montalvo Mancheno<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2017; Albrecht et al. 2021; Conservation International and World Wildlife Fund 2021). The majority (77%) of events were enacted since the year 2000, and since 2010, 2340 PADDD events have taken place, affecting more than 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> in 2.198 protected areas. Although global figures represent a conservative estimate, across countries where systematic research has been conducted, on average around 18.6% of protected areas have been affected by enacted PADDD events. Downsizings and degazettements reduced net protected area coverage in the United States of America, China, and likely elsewhere (Ma<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2019; Richards, 2018) and prevented three countries from reaching 17% terrestrial protected area coverage by 2020 (Mascia<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2014). 

    Although proximate causes vary, 61% of known enacted PADDD events were related to industrial-scale natural resource extraction and development. Smaller subsets of PADDD events were related to local pressures and land claims (28%) or conservation planning (2.5%). Notably, 10% of enacted PADDD events were later reversed, and 2.5% were offset by compensatory protected area expansions or upgrades.

    Known ecological impacts of PADDD include accelerated deforestation, increased carbon emissions, and habitat fragmentation (Forrest<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2015; Golden Kroner<span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2016). The growing scientific literature on PADDD demonstrates the need for comprehensive monitoring, transparency, rigorous analyses, and holistic policies that recognise the impermanence of some conservation initiatives and foster more durable conservation efforts and outcomes."

    title: 'Lessons from Oceania on the benefits of governance diversity'
    authors: 'Vainuupo Jungblut'

    text: "<blockquote>Most protected and conserved areas in Oceania are territories and areas conserved by indigenous peoples and local communities, but many are not recognised and therefore not counted in global databases</blockquote>
    
    A growing body of evidence suggests that sustainable interactions of people and biodiversity, often following customary law and traditional knowledge, are effective for reaching biodiversity goals (IPBES, 2018). The Nagoya Protocol further recognises the vital role that women play in access and benefit-sharing and recommends their inclusion at all levels of policy-making and implementation of biodiversity conservation. Taking into account the differentiated needs of women and men among indigenous peoples and local communities, and the varied roles they play in restoring and safeguarding biodiversity, is also key to achieving equality in environmental governance – directly impacting sustainability.

In Oceania, a large proportion of land falls under customary ownership, and diverse systems of traditional governance maintain a strong influence over natural resource management (SPREP, 2016). These traditional governance systems empower local communities and provide insight into how various management approaches and area-based tools can be mutually applied to govern a common resource (Vierros <span class='italic'>et al.</span>, 2020). Govan (2015) identifies that these systems encourage rights-based, site-specific management approaches that apply a wide range of management tools, complementing the access control measures typical of many Marine Protected Areas. 

Most protected and conserved areas in Oceania are territories and areas conserved by indigenous peoples and local communities (ICCAs). However, many ICCAs are not legally recognised and/or have not been formally registered with their respective national governments. Govan & Jupiter (2013) identify that this may be due to community perceptions that doing so “could lessen their autonomy and rights over customary lands”. Alongside a lack of recognition by governments (the primary data-providers to the WDPA and WD-OECM), this has contributed to global under-reporting of ICCAs, with the implication that ICCAs are not adequately captured in the WDPA, WD-OECM and ICCA Registry<sup>1</sup>. Privately protected areas and OECMs are similarly under-reported. This situation, if left unaddressed, will continue to impede the accuracy of coverage statistics and associated analyses, including for baselines and progress towards the future protected and conserved area targets of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.
