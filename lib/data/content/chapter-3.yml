intro: "Despite concerted global efforts and significant progress, the absolute targets to conserve 17% of land and inland water areas, and 10% of coastal and marine areas, have not yet been met. As of December 2020, XX km2 (x%) of land and inland water ecosystems, and XX km2 (x%) of coastal waters and the ocean, are within protected areas and OECMs. Despite the shortfalls, major gains in coverage have been made over the past decade, particularly in coastal waters and the oceans."

    "The WDPA has been the key tool for assessing the area covered by protected areas, and progress towards achieving Aichi Target 11, over the last decade (refs: IPBES, GEO, GBO). In the first Protected Planet Report in 2012, and in every report since, the narrative has been one of growth (refs: PP 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018). Since 2012, an additional XXX km2 of land and inland water ecosystems, and XXX km2 of coastal waters and the ocean, has been placed within protected areas. These figures, however, do not tell the entire story (Box 3) and omit many non-state protected areas (Box 4). Factoring in the limited available data on OECMs adds a further xx km2 on land and xx km2 in coastal waters and the ocean."

    "Despite this progress, neither of Aichi Target 11’s coverage goals (17% of land and inland water ecosystems and 10% of coastal waters and the ocean) were met by the close of 2020, with coverage now at xx% and xx% respectively. The same is true of Sustainable Development Goal 14.5, which also concluded in 2020 and shares the 10% target. Marine coverage can be further broken down into national waters and areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), painting a more complex picture. While great successes have been observed within national jurisdiction, where protected areas and OECMs now cover xx%, ABNJ lags behind at xx%."

content_2: "In spite of the shortfalls, much has been achieved over the past ten years, most notably in the marine realm. In recent years, terrestrial growth has been outpaced by growth in coastal waters and the oceans by [orders of magnitude?], thanks in large part to the designation of very large marine protected areas. This trend appears likely to continue into the next decade, with a further xxx km2 planned for protection at the start of 2020, spanning just x proposed marine protected areas. In comparison, since the publication of the 2012 report, terrestrial protected areas have expanded by XXX km2. "
content_3: "The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is likely to go further than the 2020 targets by proposing a coverage goal of 30%. The continued expansion of protected and conserved areas (both through new designations and through the recognition of existing measures) will be imperative to achieving the ambitious goals of the Framework and the CBD’s 2050 vision. However, it is also essential to consider the quality elements beyond coverage, in order to ensure that systems of protected and conserved areas are effective and achieve real conservation outcomes. These elements are discussed in the following sections.  "

area_charts_description: "On average, coverage of marine protected areas continues to increase rapidly since 2016, whilst the growth in terrestrial protection has largely tapered off. The extent of protected area coverage is highly variable between countries in both land and ocean. Information on future commitments collected by the CBD Secretariat suggests that with concerted efforts from governments, coverage of protected areas will increase significantly over the next two years."
