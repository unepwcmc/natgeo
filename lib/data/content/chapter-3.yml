subtitle: "Areas of Importance for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"
intro: "In 2018, 21% of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are fully covered by protected areas. Significant progress has been made in the protection of KBAs in the marine realm (EEZ), but little improvement in the coverage of terrestrial and freshwater KBAs. There is currently no equivalent dataset to assess the levels of protection of ‘areas of importance for ecosystem services’ and this remains a gap in measuring progress towards this element of Target 11. "
achi_text_2: "In January 2018, 21% of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) were estimated to be completely covered by protected areas, while 35% had no protection through systems of protected areas. On average, 47% of each terrestrial, 44% of each freshwater, and 15.9% of each marine Key Biodiversity Area (within EEZ) are within protected areas. There is therefore an important need to ensure that KBAs achieve better protection by protected areas, or other effective area-based conservation measures."

achi_text_2: "While protected area coverage of KBAs in marine areas had tripled between 2010 and 2018 (5% to 15.9%), there was slower progress in the inclusion of terrestrial and freshwater KBAs into the global protected area network since 2000 (Terrestrial: 43.3 % to 46.6%; Freshwater: 41.1 % to 43.5%)."
