    "Systems of protected and conserved areas will not function effectively if they do not cover a representative sample of the world’s ecosystems and species. It is possible to assess ecological representation based on the proportion of species’ distributions covered by protected and conserved areas. However, coverage of ecoregions (ecological units of land, ocean or freshwater that share the same biological characteristics (Olson et al. 2001; Spalding et al. 2007 and 2012)) is more generally used to assess this element of Aichi Target 11 (Gannon et al. 2019). This is the metric used here.  "

    "Since 2012, the percentage of terrestrial ecoregions reaching the 17% target has increased by xx%. The improvement is even more pronounced in the marine realm, with an increase of xx%. Furthermore, the percentage of ecoregions entirely lacking protection (less than 1% coverage by protected areas) has decreased from xx% to xx%.  "
content_2: "However, if Aichi Target 11’s coverage goals are assumed to apply to ecoregions, many remain under-protected. The proportion of terrestrial ecoregions with at least 17% protected area coverage is only 44.0% (362 ecoregions (rising to xxx when OECMs are factored in)). Among marine ecoregions and pelagic provinces, the proportion with at least 10% coverage by protected areas is 50.4% (117 ecoregions (rising to xxx when OECMs are factored in)). This figure increases to 61.3% when considering only nearshore marine ecoregions. It drops to 13.5% in pelagic provinces, which fall largely outside national jurisdiction. Methodologies and datasets for assessing coverage of freshwater ecoregions vary, but studies agree they are less than 25% protected in total (refs).  "
content_3: "There remains a clear need to improve ecoregion representation, and attention is particularly needed in ecoregions that lack protection entirely, such as the Angolan montane forest-grassland mosaic ecoregion, South China Sea Islands ecoregion, and Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests ecoregion. Two options for increasing ecological representation include greater use of systematic conservation planning (Box 7) and consideration of nationally-differentiated targets (Box 8).  "

    "As of 2018, 21% (5,510) of globally threatened species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™ are found within KBAs in Biodiversity Hotspots. Of these sites, 13% are currently fully within protected areas, while another 31% are covered only in part by protected areas."
  -
    "Another approach is based on the ‘Evolutionary Distinctiveness’ (the unique contribution of a species to total evolutionary history) and ‘Global Endangerment’ (extinction risk derived from the IUCN Red List) of species. A total of 1,261 or 43% of all EDGE species are found in 2,803 KBAs in 21 Biodiversity Hotspots, with 14% of these sites with EDGE species being fully within protected areas and 35% partially within protected areas."
  -
    "There is currently no global dataset or analysis that provides a measure of how well protected areas cover ‘areas of particular importance for ecosystem services’, which constitutes a clear gap to be addressed to fully report progress in the achievement of Aichi Target 11."
