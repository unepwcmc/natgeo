subtitle: "Chapter 3"
intro: "In 2020, 19% of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) were fully covered by protected areas. Significant progress has been made in the protection of KBAs in the marine realm (EEZ), but little improvement in the coverage of terrestrial and freshwater KBAs. There is currently no equivalent dataset to assess the levels of protection of ‘areas of importance for ecosystem services’ and this remains a gap in measuring progress towards this element of Target 11."

    "In 2020, 19% of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) were estimated to be completely covered by protected areas, while 39% had no protection through systems of protected areas. On average, 44% of each terrestrial, 41% of each freshwater, and 46% of each marine Key Biodiversity Area (within EEZ) are within protected areas. There is therefore an important need to ensure that KBAs achieve better protection by protected areas, or other effective area-based conservation measures."
  -
    "Between 2010 and 2020 average protected area coverage of KBAs has increased in marine, terrestrial and freshwater KBAs at more or less the same pace. The highest growth has been in marine KBAs (41% - 46%) followed by freshwater KBAs (38% - 41%) and terrestrial KBAs (41% - 44%)."

    "As of 2018, 21% (5,510) of globally threatened species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™ are found within KBAs in Biodiversity Hotspots. Of these sites, 13% are currently fully within protected areas, while another 31% are covered only in part by protected areas."

    "Another approach is based on the ‘Evolutionary Distinctiveness’ (the unique contribution of a species to total evolutionary history) and ‘Global Endangerment’ (extinction risk derived from the IUCN Red List) of species. A total of 1,261 or 43% of all EDGE species are found in 2,803 KBAs in 21 Biodiversity Hotspots, with 14% of these sites with EDGE species being fully within protected areas and 35% partially within protected areas."

    "There is currently no global dataset or analysis that provides a measure of how well protected areas cover ‘areas of particular importance for ecosystem services’, which constitutes a clear gap to be addressed to fully report progress in the achievement of Aichi Target 11."

    title: 'Systematic Conservation Planning'
    authors: 'Javier Fajardo and Andy Arnell'
    org: 'UNEP-WCMC'
    text: "Systematic approaches to conservation planning (Margules & Pressey 2000) have been developed over the last three decades to provide decision support to efficiently meet conservation goals, including by ensuring that conservation networks are representative of species and ecosystems. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) typically uses spatial analysis and selection algorithms to prioritise areas for protection, thereby maximising positive outcomes for biodiversity while minimising economic and societal costs. \n
           The approach is based on clearly stated underlying principles and target-setting, promoting transparency and accountability in decision making. Crucially, SCP should be used alongside consultations with local people and other stakeholders to identify where and how conservation efforts should be scaled up – either by establishing new protected and conserved areas, or by providing increased support to measures not previously considered part of the formal conservation network. \n
            Since its inception, SCP has been embraced by large conservation organisations and governments, providing decision support for the design and improvement of protected area networks worldwide (McIntosh et al. 2017). Examples of success span from the recent declaration of Tun Mustapha Park in Malaysia following a SCP process (Jumin et al. 2018) to the zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia (Fernandes et al. 2005) and plans for the conservation network in South Africa (Knight et al. 2006). Together with solving problems such as the smarter consideration of OECMs in addition to protected areas, or finding imaginative solutions to account for climate change, SCP is regarded as a key tool to achieve a future where humans and nature thrive together."

    title: 'Global conservation area targets will be most efficiently met through differentiated responsibilities at the country level'
    authors: 'Xiaoli Shen'
    text: "Countries are encouraged by CBD to adapt conservation area targets to national conditions (CBD, 2010). However, a uniform conservation target – with each country adopting the same percentage coverage target as the global target – has often been accepted by contracting parties under previous conservation frameworks. Given that biodiversity is unevenly distributed across the planet and accounting for a wide variety of national contexts, a more efficient approach to protecting global biodiversity would be for countries to adopt differentiated conservation targets while the total global coverage target remains the same.\n
          This approach was explored in a recent study [insert study], which generated spatial prioritisations using the 30% and 50% conservation targets proposed in the build-up to the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD, 2020). These spatial prioritizations aimed to maximize the conservation of species diversity and carbon, ensure representativeness among ecoregions and minimize the total cost of the solution. The findings suggested that allowing different percentage targets for different countries, adding up to a global target (i.e., 30% or 50%), would conserve far more terrestrial vertebrate species and carbon stocks than setting uniform targets for all countries. However, the largely varied conservation targets among countries (nearly 100% of some countries’ land mass) and heavier conservation burdens for economically-poorer countries indicate substantial (and in some cases insurmountable) challenges for countries to achieve these conservation targets. \n
          If some of these challenges could be addressed, then the different targets identified could serve as the basis for countries to develop nationally-appropriate targets (which might vary depending on whether biodiversity, ecosystem services, or other values are prioritised). Approaches to mobilize transformative change (e.g. the Three Global Conditions, Locke et al. 2019), and mechanisms to ensure fair sharing of conservation burdens among countries, would be needed to support countries with high conservation targets."

Countries with a terrestrial area < 18,000 km2 are excluded.'
