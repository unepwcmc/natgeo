subtitle: "Chapter 3"
intro: "Despite concerted global efforts and significant progress, the absolute targets to conserve 17% of land and inland water areas, and 10% of coastal and marine areas, have not yet been met. As of December 2020, XX km2 (x%) of land and inland water ecosystems, and XX km2 (x%) of coastal waters and the ocean, are within protected areas and OECMs. Despite the shortfalls, major gains in coverage have been made over the past decade, particularly in coastal waters and the oceans."

    "The WDPA has been the key tool for assessing the area covered by protected areas, and progress towards achieving Aichi Target 11, over the last decade (refs: IPBES, GEO, GBO). In the first Protected Planet Report in 2012, and in every report since, the narrative has been one of growth (refs: PP 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018). Since 2012, an additional XXX km2 of land and inland water ecosystems, and XXX km2 of coastal waters and the ocean, has been placed within protected areas. These figures, however, do not tell the entire story (Box 3) and omit many non-state protected areas (Box 4). Factoring in the limited available data on OECMs adds a further xx km2 on land and xx km2 in coastal waters and the ocean."

    "Despite this progress, neither of Aichi Target 11’s coverage goals (17% of land and inland water ecosystems and 10% of coastal waters and the ocean) were met by the close of 2020, with coverage now at xx% and xx% respectively. The same is true of Sustainable Development Goal 14.5, which also concluded in 2020 and shares the 10% target. Marine coverage can be further broken down into national waters and areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), painting a more complex picture. While great successes have been observed within national jurisdiction, where protected areas and OECMs now cover xx%, ABNJ lags behind at xx%."

content_2: "In spite of the shortfalls, much has been achieved over the past ten years, most notably in the marine realm. In recent years, terrestrial growth has been outpaced by growth in coastal waters and the oceans by [orders of magnitude?], thanks in large part to the designation of very large marine protected areas. This trend appears likely to continue into the next decade, with a further xxx km2 planned for protection at the start of 2020, spanning just x proposed marine protected areas. In comparison, since the publication of the 2012 report, terrestrial protected areas have expanded by XXX km2. "
content_3: "The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is likely to go further than the 2020 targets by proposing a coverage goal of 30%. The continued expansion of protected and conserved areas (both through new designations and through the recognition of existing measures) will be imperative to achieving the ambitious goals of the Framework and the CBD’s 2050 vision. However, it is also essential to consider the quality elements beyond coverage, in order to ensure that systems of protected and conserved areas are effective and achieve real conservation outcomes. These elements are discussed in the following sections.  "

area_charts_description: "On average, coverage of marine protected areas continues to increase rapidly since 2016, whilst the growth in terrestrial protection has largely tapered off. The extent of protected area coverage is highly variable between countries in both land and ocean. Information on future commitments collected by the CBD Secretariat suggests that with concerted efforts from governments, coverage of protected areas will increase significantly over the next two years."

    title: 'Systematic Conservation Planning'
    authors: 'Javier Fajardo and Andy Arnell'

    text: "Systematic approaches to conservation planning (Margules & Pressey 2000) have been developed over the last three decades to provide decision support to efficiently meet conservation goals, including by ensuring that conservation networks are representative of species and ecosystems. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) typically uses spatial analysis and selection algorithms to prioritise areas for protection, thereby maximising positive outcomes for biodiversity while minimising economic and societal costs. \n
           The approach is based on clearly stated underlying principles and target-setting, promoting transparency and accountability in decision making. Crucially, SCP should be used alongside consultations with local people and other stakeholders to identify where and how conservation efforts should be scaled up – either by establishing new protected and conserved areas, or by providing increased support to measures not previously considered part of the formal conservation network. \n
            Since its inception, SCP has been embraced by large conservation organisations and governments, providing decision support for the design and improvement of protected area networks worldwide (McIntosh et al. 2017). Examples of success span from the recent declaration of Tun Mustapha Park in Malaysia following a SCP process (Jumin et al. 2018) to the zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia (Fernandes et al. 2005) and plans for the conservation network in South Africa (Knight et al. 2006). Together with solving problems such as the smarter consideration of OECMs in addition to protected areas, or finding imaginative solutions to account for climate change, SCP is regarded as a key tool to achieve a future where humans and nature thrive together."

    title: 'Global conservation area targets will be most efficiently met through differentiated responsibilities at the country level'
    authors: 'Xiaoli Shen'
    text: "Countries are encouraged by CBD to adapt conservation area targets to national conditions (CBD, 2010). However, a uniform conservation target – with each country adopting the same percentage coverage target as the global target – has often been accepted by contracting parties under previous conservation frameworks. Given that biodiversity is unevenly distributed across the planet and accounting for a wide variety of national contexts, a more efficient approach to protecting global biodiversity would be for countries to adopt differentiated conservation targets while the total global coverage target remains the same.\n
          This approach was explored in a recent study [insert study], which generated spatial prioritisations using the 30% and 50% conservation targets proposed in the build-up to the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD, 2020). These spatial prioritizations aimed to maximize the conservation of species diversity and carbon, ensure representativeness among ecoregions and minimize the total cost of the solution. The findings suggested that allowing different percentage targets for different countries, adding up to a global target (i.e., 30% or 50%), would conserve far more terrestrial vertebrate species and carbon stocks than setting uniform targets for all countries. However, the largely varied conservation targets among countries (nearly 100% of some countries’ land mass) and heavier conservation burdens for economically-poorer countries indicate substantial (and in some cases insurmountable) challenges for countries to achieve these conservation targets. \n
          If some of these challenges could be addressed, then the different targets identified could serve as the basis for countries to develop nationally-appropriate targets (which might vary depending on whether biodiversity, ecosystem services, or other values are prioritised). Approaches to mobilize transformative change (e.g. the Three Global Conditions, Locke et al. 2019), and mechanisms to ensure fair sharing of conservation burdens among countries, would be needed to support countries with high conservation targets."

Countries with a terrestrial area < 18,000 km2 are excluded.'
