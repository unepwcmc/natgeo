intro: "Since 2010, methodologies have been developed for the assessment of global connectivity on land. As of December 2020, 7.04% of the world’s terrestrial surface is both protected and connected, rising to 7.84% when OECMs are included. This figure is an improvement on 2018 figures, but remains below 17%. Methods to assess marine connectivity are being developed and refined."

  - "This section focuses on the degree to which the world’s system of protected and conserved areas is geographically connected. A well-connected conservation network is one where ecological processes and functions connect between different sites. This includes sustaining the ability of individuals or populations of species to move between sites, providing resilience against climate change (Box 11), and is an essential component of healthy ecosystem functioning. It is also one that has increasingly been impacted by human activities (Tucker <em>et al.</em>, 2018)"
  - "When the Protected Planet Report was first published in 2012, the science of measuring connectivity was in its infancy. This is one area where great strides have been taken during the lifetime of Aichi Target 11: terrestrial connectivity can now be measured, and methods are in development for marine connectivity (Box 12). Metrics such as Protected Connected (ProtConn) and PARC-Connectedness are now widely used to assess structural connectivity between protected areas."
  - "Based on the ProtConn method, 7.84% of the world’s terrestrial surface is both protected and connected when OECMs are included, far below the 17% required by Aichi Target 11. However, since 2010 this figure has increased from 6.5% (Saura <em>et al.</em>, 2019), showing a marked improvement over the decade. Due to the limited available data, our understanding of the true degree to which OECMs influence connectivity is currently minimal. "

blockquote_text: "However, OECMs have significant potential to enhance the measures of connectivity once they have been more extensively identified, mapped and recognised.  "

content_2: "Already we know that they increase the proportion of the world that is protected and connected by 0.8 percentage points, despite the extremely limited data. Furthermore, there is a need for more consideration of connectivity outside and between protected areas and OECMs. Such connectivity is provided primarily through ecological corridors. Like OECMs, ecological corridors have not yet been identified or mapped at a significant scale, and further work is needed before they can be factored into connectivity analyses."

    Connectivity conservation is rapidly emerging as a critical approach to saving biodiversity in the face of habitat fragmentation and climate change. The biosphere is dynamic; its interrelated functions depend on ‘ecological connectivity’ – defined by the Convention on Migratory Species as “the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth”. In much of the world, where large-scale human activities have fragmented nature, ecological connectivity has been eroded, putting species and natural processes at risk. However, well-connected ecological networks comprising protected areas, OECMs and ecological corridors can mitigate the impacts of fragmentation. This is especially important for climate change adaptation, providing species with pathways to move and respond to changing environmental conditions. Ecological connectivity is a tried and true approach to managing biodiversity in the face of climate change.  \n
          The importance of promoting ecological connectivity is underlined throughout the 5th Global Biodiversity Outlook (CBD, 2020), and successful connectivity conservation approaches can span multiple cultures, geographies, and patterns of governance and ownership, all helping to achieve the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity. Methods of achieving connectivity across land, sea and air encompass wildlife corridors, marine swimways, avian and bat flyways, pollinator pathways, riparian zones, streamflow regimes and climate corridors. By conserving connectivity, the circulatory system of nature is sustained."

    text: "<blockquote>Unprotected seagrass habitat can significantly boost the functional connectivity of protected marine habitats through 'stepping-stone' effects: a reason to consider the wider seascape in conservation and restoration planning</blockquote>
    
    Oceans are complex systems, and marine connectivity can be estimated and predicted differently depending on the approaches applied and metrics used (Bryan-Brown <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Ocean circulation, habitat structures, nutrients and genetics can exhibit diverse connectivity patterns. A multidisciplinary approach is therefore fundamental to obtaining the best guidelines for incorporating connectivity into Marine Protected Area (MPA) network design (Balbar and Metaxas, 2019). \n
          Although a standardised global methodology for assessing marine connectivity is yet to be developed, there has been extensive research conducted to evaluate connectivity across the Wider Caribbean region (Truelove <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Chollett <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Knowles <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Schill <em>et al.</em>, 2015). A recent pilot study under the <a title='Visit BIOPAMA' href='https://www.biopama.org/' target='_blank'>BIOPAMA programme</a> adapted the ProtConn indicator to assess the importance of protected areas for seagrass habitat connectivity across the Caribbean<sup>1</sup>. This study identified several data challenges and considerations for the marine realm, which will be incorporated into the development of a global marine ProtConn indicator<sup>2</sup>. The Figure above shows the configuration of seagrass across the Caribbean, 20% of which is under protection from sites recorded in the WDPA. When comparing the functional connectivity of the seagrass habitat network, regardless of protection status, to that of the network containing only protected sites, the unprotected areas boost the overall available habitat while increasing its relative reachability, largely through increases in stepping-stone connectivity.\n
          This analysis allows the identification of protected areas whose connection to the network is particularly vulnerable and where extra buffering or linking could be considered. The method provides additional benefits by prioritising areas where strategic interventions are feasible, highlighting the importance of comprehensive habitat maps that, when paired with local knowledge, can inform design and management decisions.\n

          <sup>2</sup> ProtConn: Protected Connected (ProtConn) is an indicator developed by The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre that quantifies the percentage of a region covered by protected connected lands, and differentiates several categories of land (unprotected, protected or transboundary) through which movement between protected locations may occur (European Commission, 2017)."
