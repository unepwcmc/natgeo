subtitle: "Chapter 8"
intro: "‘Other effective area-based conservation measures’ (OECMs) can complement protected areas in delivering conservation outcomes. A definition of OECM and guidelines for the identification and recognition of OECMs has been recommended for adoption at the CBD COP 14 in November 2018. This will facilitate more comprehensive reporting on progress towards this element of Aichi Target 11 and future area-based conservation targets. However, a global baseline of existing OECMs will be required before such global quantitative targets can be meaningfully established and assessed."
content_1: "<p>The proposed definition from the CBD SBSTTA (CBD Secretariat, 2018b) for Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measure is:</p> <p>'A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and, where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socioeconomic, and other locally relevant values'. Once adopted, the definition and associated guidance on criteria for identification will pave the way for recognition and reporting of these areas, which are managed to achieve a range of objectives.</p><p>According to the IUCN WCPA, OECMs can be divided into three broad categories:</p><ul><li>Those with primary conservation objectives, such as a territory governed by indigenous people, where those people wish their territory to be recognised as an OECM rather than a protected area;</li><li>Those with secondary conservation objectives, such as watersheds managed primarily for water resource management, but with secondary conservation objectives;</li><li>Areas managed for other objectives but where such management delivers effective conservation (ancillary conservation), such as military lands and waters where restricted access has resulted in effective protection of habitats and species.'</li></ul>"

cta_text: "This case study discusses one particular governance category, lands and waters under indigenous peoples’ or communal tenure, which may in some cases fulfil the OECM definition. "

content_2: "Currently, due to historical data collection methods and reporting obligations, the WDPA consists primarily of data on protected areas reported by governments, and it is a requirement that all sites included in the database meet the IUCN or CBD definition of a protected area. However, once Parties to the CBD have adopted an OECM definition, governments will be encouraged to provide data on OECMs alongside protected areas."
