intro: "‘Other effective area-based conservation measures’ (OECMs) can complement protected areas in delivering conservation outcomes. A definition of OECMs has been adopted at the CBD COP 14 in November 2018, and guidelines for their identification and recognition have been developed. However, a global baseline of existing OECMs will be required before such global quantitative targets can be meaningfully established and assessed."
content_1: "<p>The adopted definition of Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measure (OECM) is: </p> <p>'A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and, where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socioeconomic, and other locally relevant values'. This definition and associated guidance on criteria for identification now paves the way for recognition and reporting of these areas, which are managed to achieve a range of objectives.</p><p>According to the IUCN WCPA, OECMs can be divided into three broad categories:</p><ul><li>Those with primary conservation objectives, such as a territory governed by indigenous people, where those people wish their territory to be recognised as an OECM rather than a protected area;</li><li>Those with secondary conservation objectives, such as watersheds managed primarily for water resource management, but with secondary conservation objectives;</li><li>Areas managed for other objectives but where such management delivers effective conservation (ancillary conservation), such as military lands and waters where restricted access has resulted in effective protection of habitats and species.'</li></ul>"

content_2: "<p>Currently, due to historical data collection methods and reporting obligations, the WDPA consists primarily of data on protected areas reported by governments, and it is a requirement that all sites included in the database meet the IUCN or CBD definition of a protected area. Now that Parties to the CBD have adopted an OECM definition, governments are encouraged to provide data on OECMs alongside protected areas. As of September 2020, there are now 146 recorded OECMS spanning almost 61,000 km<sup>2</sup> of land and over 273,000 km<sup>2</sup> of ocean.</p><p> There is now published guidance on <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/48773\" target=\"_\">recognising and reporting OECMs</a> as well as a <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/content/documents/iucn_oecm_methodology_-_draft_1.0_-_december_2019.docx\" target=\"_\">draft methodology</a> for identifying, reporting and supporting OECMS.</p>"

    title: 'Economic benefits of marine protected areas'

    text: Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can provide economic benefits through tourism, enhanced fishing yields in neighbouring areas, and other services, some of which are difficult to quantify (e.g., insurance value, local amenity value, storm protection, political value, intangible capital). In weighing the benefits and costs of establishing an MPA, a primary concern is often the loss of fishing grounds and yields that may occur; but these effects can be offset by the increase in spillover and dispersal of larvae provided by MPAs. Furthermore, aggregate benefits afforded by protection can be much greater than the putative loss of fisheries yield. These benefits are more apparent in fully protected areas that ban fishing and allow for full recovery of marine life within their boundaries – and greater export beyond their boundaries. Empirical data show that the economic benefits of reserves can offset the costs of closure in as little as five years – in some cases doubling the income of local fishers – and bringing in economic revenue from ecotourism many times larger than the unprotected counterfactual. These aggregate benefits have been proven for fully protected MPAs ranging between 1 km2 – 1.5 million km2, and fisheries benefits for species from small (scallops, lobsters) to large (tuna). If designed properly, MPAs with high levels of protection can help restore marine biodiversity and ecosystem services, and can create jobs, help fishers, and bring in significantly greater economic profits than in the absence of protection. MPAs can be an investment in future prosperity rather than a foregone economic opportunity.
