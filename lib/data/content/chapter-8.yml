  - "This section focuses on the degree to which the world’s system of protected and conserved areas is geographically connected. A well-connected conservation network is one where species can move between different sites. This is an essential component of healthy ecosystem functioning, and one that has increasingly been impacted by human activities (Tucker et al. 2018). Well-connected ecological networks play a critical role in sustaining and maintaining land and seascape permeability, increasing resilience to climate change (Box 11), and retaining the ecological processes essential to all life on Earth.   "
  - "When the Protected Planet Report was first published in 2012, the science of measuring connectivity was in its infancy. This is one area where great strides have been taken during the lifetime of Aichi Target 11: terrestrial connectivity can now be measured, and methods are in development for marine connectivity (Box 12). Metrics such as Protected Connected (ProtConn) and PARC-Connectedness are now widely used to assess structural connectivity between protected areas.  "
  - "Based on the ProtConn method, xx% of the world’s terrestrial surface is both protected and connected. Since ProtConn results were first included in the Protected Planet Report in 2018, this figure has increased by xx%, but it nevertheless remains below the 17% required by Aichi Target 11. Due to the limited available data, the degree to which OECMs influence connectivity is currently minimal. However, OECMs have significant potential to enhance connectivity once they have been more extensively identified, mapped and recognised. Furthermore, there is a need for more consideration of connectivity outside and between protected areas and OECMs. Such connectivity is provided primarily through ecological corridors. Like OECMs, ecological corridors have not yet been identified or mapped at a significant scale, and further work is needed before they can be factored into connectivity analyses.  "

content_2: "In July 2020, the IUCN WCPA Connectivity Conservation Specialist Group (CCSG) published the IUCN Guidelines for Conserving Connectivity through Ecological Networks and Corridors (ref). The Guidelines are an important step towards a coherent global approach for connectivity conservation, providing clarity on the role of ecological corridors.  "

    title: 'Economic benefits of marine protected areas'

    text: Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can provide economic benefits through tourism, enhanced fishing yields in neighbouring areas, and other services, some of which are difficult to quantify (e.g., insurance value, local amenity value, storm protection, political value, intangible capital). In weighing the benefits and costs of establishing an MPA, a primary concern is often the loss of fishing grounds and yields that may occur; but these effects can be offset by the increase in spillover and dispersal of larvae provided by MPAs. Furthermore, aggregate benefits afforded by protection can be much greater than the putative loss of fisheries yield. These benefits are more apparent in fully protected areas that ban fishing and allow for full recovery of marine life within their boundaries – and greater export beyond their boundaries. Empirical data show that the economic benefits of reserves can offset the costs of closure in as little as five years – in some cases doubling the income of local fishers – and bringing in economic revenue from ecotourism many times larger than the unprotected counterfactual. These aggregate benefits have been proven for fully protected MPAs ranging between 1 km2 – 1.5 million km2, and fisheries benefits for species from small (scallops, lobsters) to large (tuna). If designed properly, MPAs with high levels of protection can help restore marine biodiversity and ecosystem services, and can create jobs, help fishers, and bring in significantly greater economic profits than in the absence of protection. MPAs can be an investment in future prosperity rather than a foregone economic opportunity.
