content: "<p>The proposed definition from the CBD SBSTTA (CBD Secretariat, 2018b) for Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measure is: 'A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and, where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socioeconomic, and other locally relevant values'. Once adopted, the definition and associated guidance on criteria for identification will pave the way for recognition and reporting of these areas, which are managed to achieve a range of objectives.</p><p>According to the IUCN WCPA, OECMs can be divided into three broad categories:</p><ul><li>Those with primary conservation objectives, such as a territory governed by indigenous people, where those people wish their territory to be recognised as an OECM rather than a protected area;</li><li>Those with secondary conservation objectives, such as watersheds managed primarily for water resource management, but with secondary conservation objectives;</li><li>Areas managed for other objectives but where such management delivers effective conservation (ancillary conservation), such as military lands and waters where restricted access has resulted in effective protection of habitats and species.'</li></ul>"
