content_2: "The diversity of governance types of protected areas provides an indication of the recognition of the diverse actors involved in these conservation efforts, although it does not itself inform an understanding of whether this is good governance or equitable management. Protected areas under all IUCN governance types can be reported to the WDPA, but non-government types are currently under-reported, with 82% of recorded protected areas managed by government agencies."
