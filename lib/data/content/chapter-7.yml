  - "The next element of Aichi Target 11, ‘equitably managed’, is more correctly understood as ‘equitably governed’ (CBD, 2018) since it relates to the quality of governance (good governance) in protected and conserved areas, including across dimensions of equity. In this context, equity can be understood as encompassing recognition, procedure and distribution. Equity is about respect for stakeholders and their rights; about decision-making processes, including transparency, accountability and dispute resolution; and about the fair distribution of costs and benefits. When applied correctly, these elements of governance have important benefits. Firstly, they ensure that the costs of conservation are not borne by the world’s poorest people while its benefits are enjoyed by the richest. Secondly, they enable the equitable participation of women and other marginalised groups. Thirdly, they are necessary to building conservation networks that have the support of local people, a factor that is closely linked to positive biodiversity outcomes (ref).  "
  - "There have been recent advances in our understanding of governance and equity (ref IIED, Noelia, ICCA governance primer), and methodologies have been designed to assess equity and governance in the protected area context. For example, the Site-level Assessment of Governance and Equity (SAGE) methodology (ref) (developed through the joint efforts of conservation agencies, NGOs and research organisations led by IIED) enables site-level stakeholders to improve the governance and equity of their conservation work. Furthermore, it generates information for stakeholders at higher levels This informs better management oversight, improving the governance of the protected and conserved area system as a whole, and informing national and global reporting. "
  - "SAGE takes the form of a multi-stakeholder self-assessment that distinguishes perspectives from different stakeholder groups, including by gender. The SAGE questionnaire is designed around ten principles of equity and governance. It captures qualitative information including specific governance challenges identified by different stakeholders, reasons for differences in perspectives, and potential actions to address the challenges and promote convergence of perspectives. SAGE includes optional modules on improving governance, equity and monitoring. It is also being linked to various IUCN Green List assessments.   "

content_2: "Despite these advances, achieving equitable governance remains one of the greatest challenges faced by the world’s conservation network. Among other things, an equitably-governed conservation network is one where a diversity of governance types is recognised (Box 10). Unfortunately, the conservation efforts of private actors, indigenous peoples and local communities remain undervalued and under-reported to the WDPA and WD-OECM, though their contributions to conservation are extensive (ref WWF). Post-2020, there is a need for greater recognition of the role of non-state actors in conservation, and, with their consent, improved reporting of non-state protected areas and OECMs to the WDPA and WD-OECM. There is also a need to roll out and refine methodologies like SAGE, establish and maintain a global reporting system for equity assessments, and use the information reported to truly ensure that the world’s conservation network works for people as well as nature.

    title: 'Governance assessments in Territories of Life'
    authors: 'Jennifer Kelleher - Programme Lead, Governance, Equity & Rights, Global Protected Areas Programme, IUCN, Dr. Stephen Nindi - Director General National Land Use Planning Commission (NLUPC) Tanzania. '
    text: "The IUCN approaches equity through the lens of governance; a concept that is concerned with decision making in protected and conserved areas – who has been making decisions? How have those decisions been made and who has participated? The IUCN distinguishes four main types of governance in protected and conserves areas: A. government B. shared; C. private; and D. “territories and areas conserved by indigenous peoples and local communities” or “territories of life” (also referred to as ICCAs).\n
           Issues relating to governance were examined during a series of national dialogues held during 2017-2019, one of which was convened in Tanzania by the Global Protected Areas Programme of IUCN, together with Tanzanian authorities, traditional knowledge holders and other experts. The process revealed Tanzania as one of the richest countries on Earth with regard to its biodiversity and its governance diversity. The system of PAs includes Africa’s highest peak and four natural World Heritage Sites: Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Kilimanjaro National Park, Selous Game Reserve (now Nyerere National Park) and Serengeti National Park. It also includes shared governance models such as Wildlife Management Areas, Village Forests and Game Reserves, alongside areas conserved under Certificates of Customary Right of Occupancy (CCROs). \n
           Governance diversity has positive implications for people and nature in Tanzania, with areas under the traditional governance, management and custodianship of indigenous peoples and local communities demonstrating long-term conservation effectiveness. Traditional institutions for landscape conservation in the Matengo Highlands illustrate how traditional knowledge under the customary Sengu system can achieve both sustainable livelihoods and conservation of the landscape. The Sengu system manages the sustainability of the steep slopes of the Ntambo landholding through traditional cultivation systems known as ngolo (four-tiered ridges). This system has its governance structure formalized in the Tanzanian regulatory framework, revealing an impressive rooting of conservation in both traditional and modern national cultural identities. Examples such as this can be of rich value to the world, demonstrating how good governance, and recognition of diverse governance types, can contribute to successful systems of protected and conserved areas."
