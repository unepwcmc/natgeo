  - "The next element of Aichi Target 11, ‘equitably managed’, is more correctly understood as ‘equitably governed’ (CBD, 2018) since it relates to the quality of governance (good governance) in protected and conserved areas, including across dimensions of equity. In this context, equity can be understood as encompassing recognition, procedure and distribution. Equity is about respect for stakeholders and their rights; about decision-making processes, including transparency, accountability and dispute resolution; and about the fair distribution of costs and benefits. When applied correctly, these elements of governance have important benefits. Firstly, they ensure that the costs of conservation are not borne by the world’s poorest people while its benefits are enjoyed by the richest. Secondly, they enable the equitable participation of women and other marginalised groups. Thirdly, they are necessary to building conservation networks that have the support of local people, a factor that is closely linked to positive biodiversity outcomes (ref).  "
  - "There have been recent advances in our understanding of governance and equity (ref IIED, Noelia, ICCA governance primer), and methodologies have been designed to assess equity and governance in the protected area context. For example, the Site-level Assessment of Governance and Equity (SAGE) methodology (ref) (developed through the joint efforts of conservation agencies, NGOs and research organisations led by IIED) enables site-level stakeholders to improve the governance and equity of their conservation work. Furthermore, it generates information for stakeholders at higher levels This informs better management oversight, improving the governance of the protected and conserved area system as a whole, and informing national and global reporting. "
  - "SAGE takes the form of a multi-stakeholder self-assessment that distinguishes perspectives from different stakeholder groups, including by gender. The SAGE questionnaire is designed around ten principles of equity and governance. It captures qualitative information including specific governance challenges identified by different stakeholders, reasons for differences in perspectives, and potential actions to address the challenges and promote convergence of perspectives. SAGE includes optional modules on improving governance, equity and monitoring. It is also being linked to various IUCN Green List assessments.   "

content_2: "Despite these advances, achieving equitable governance remains one of the greatest challenges faced by the world’s conservation network. Among other things, an equitably-governed conservation network is one where a diversity of governance types is recognised (Box 10). Unfortunately, the conservation efforts of private actors, indigenous peoples and local communities remain undervalued and under-reported to the WDPA and WD-OECM, though their contributions to conservation are extensive (ref WWF). Post-2020, there is a need for greater recognition of the role of non-state actors in conservation, and, with their consent, improved reporting of non-state protected areas and OECMs to the WDPA and WD-OECM. There is also a need to roll out and refine methodologies like SAGE, establish and maintain a global reporting system for equity assessments, and use the information reported to truly ensure that the world’s conservation network works for people as well as nature.

    title: 'Maintaining ecological processes, and adapting to climate change, through connectivity '
    authors: 'Gary Tabor'
    org: 'Chair, IUCN WCPA Connectivity Conservation Specialist Group'
    text: "Connectivity conservation is rapidly emerging as a critical approach to saving biodiversity in the face of habitat fragmentation and climate change. The biosphere is dynamic; its interrelated functions depend on ‘ecological connectivity’ – defined by the Convention on Migratory Species as “the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth”. In much of the world, where large-scale human activities have fragmented nature, ecological connectivity has been eroded, putting species and natural processes at risk. However, well-connected ecological networks comprised of protected areas, OECMs and ecological corridors can mitigate the impacts of fragmentation. This is especially important for climate change adaptation, providing species with ways to move and respond to changing environmental conditions. \n
          The importance of promoting ecological connectivity is underlined throughout the 5th Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5), and successful connectivity conservation approaches can span multiple cultures, geographies, and patterns of governance and ownership, all helping to achieve the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity. Methods of achieving connectivity across land, sea and air encompass wildlife corridors, marine swimways, avian and bat flyways, pollinator pathways, riparian zones, streamflow regimes and climate corridors. In response to the growing application of connectivity conservation, IUCN has also published Guidelines for Conserving Connectivity through Ecological Networks and Corridors. The guidelines advance more consistent practices to ensure well-connected terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems that underpin all dynamic aspects of nature conservation. By conserving connectivity, the circulatory system of nature is sustained."

    source: 'This analysis allows the identification of protected areas whose connection to the network is particularly vulnerable and where extra buffering or linking could be considered. The method provides additional benefits by prioritising areas where strategic interventions are feasible, highlighting the importance of comprehensive habitat maps that, when paired with local knowledge, can inform design and management decisions.'
    text: "Oceans are complex systems, and marine connectivity can be estimated and predicted differently depending on the approaches applied and metrics used . Ocean circulation, habitat structures, nutrients and genetics can exhibit diverse connectivity patterns and a multidisciplinary approach is fundamental to obtain the best guidelines for MPA network design.\n
          Although a standardised global methodology for assessing marine connectivity is yet to be developed, there has been extensive research conducted to evaluate connectivity across the Wider Caribbean region        . A recent pilot study under the BIOPAMA programme  adapted the ProtConn indicator  to assess the importance of protected areas for seagrass habitat connectivity across the Caribbean . This study identified several data challenges and considerations for the marine realm, which will be incorporated into the development of a global marine ProtConn indicator. Figure 1 shows the configuration of seagrass across the Caribbean, 20% of which is under protection from sites recorded in the WDPA. When comparing the functional connectivity of the seagrass habitat network, regardless of protection status, to that of the network containing only protected sites, the unprotected areas boost the overall available habitat while increasing its relative reachability, largely through increases in stepping-stone connectivity."
