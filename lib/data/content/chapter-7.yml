intro: "Connectivity between protected areas is essential to maintain the viability of species, communities and ecosystems. Metrics to measure connectivity at the global level have been developed, and reveal that about half of the global protected area network consist in connected lands, and that 30% of countries currently meet the connectivity element of Aichi Target 11. There are at present no available analyses of trends in protected area connectivity over time. However, many countries have now developed connectivity initiatives to enhance ecological connections between protected areas, in an effort to counter the ongoing fragmentation of ecosystems."
content_1: "Connectivity is particularly important given the many threats faced by biodiversity, including from climate change, and the increasing isolation of natural habitats in many parts of the world. A number of initiatives have recently been developed at various scales to promote connectivity between protected areas and other conservation areas."

content_2: "At the global level, a new indicator, “Protected Connected” (ProtConn), was recently developed to quantify the degree to which national terrestrial protected area systems are well designed to promote connectivity. This study found that on average 7.5% of the terrestrial surface of the planet is covered by protected connected lands, which is about half of the global protected area coverage (~15.0%), and that 30% of the countries currently meet the connectivity element of Aichi Target 11."

    title: 'Maintaining ecological processes, and adapting to climate change, through connectivity '
    authors: 'Gary Tabor'
    org: 'Chair, IUCN WCPA Connectivity Conservation Specialist Group'
    text: "Connectivity conservation is rapidly emerging as a critical approach to saving biodiversity in the face of habitat fragmentation and climate change. The biosphere is dynamic; its interrelated functions depend on ‘ecological connectivity’ – defined by the Convention on Migratory Species as “the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth”. In much of the world, where large-scale human activities have fragmented nature, ecological connectivity has been eroded, putting species and natural processes at risk. However, well-connected ecological networks comprised of protected areas, OECMs and ecological corridors can mitigate the impacts of fragmentation. This is especially important for climate change adaptation, providing species with ways to move and respond to changing environmental conditions. \n
          The importance of promoting ecological connectivity is underlined throughout the 5th Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5), and successful connectivity conservation approaches can span multiple cultures, geographies, and patterns of governance and ownership, all helping to achieve the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity. Methods of achieving connectivity across land, sea and air encompass wildlife corridors, marine swimways, avian and bat flyways, pollinator pathways, riparian zones, streamflow regimes and climate corridors. In response to the growing application of connectivity conservation, IUCN has also published Guidelines for Conserving Connectivity through Ecological Networks and Corridors. The guidelines advance more consistent practices to ensure well-connected terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems that underpin all dynamic aspects of nature conservation. By conserving connectivity, the circulatory system of nature is sustained."

    title: 'Marine Protected Area (MPA) Networks: Connectivity research from the Caribbean. '

    caption: 'Figure x: Protected (green) and unprotected (red) areas of seagrass across the Caribbean pilot study region.'
    source: 'This analysis allows the identification of protected areas whose connection to the network is particularly vulnerable and where extra buffering or linking could be considered. The method provides additional benefits by prioritising areas where strategic interventions are feasible, highlighting the importance of comprehensive habitat maps that, when paired with local knowledge, can inform design and management decisions.'
    text: "Oceans are complex systems, and marine connectivity can be estimated and predicted differently depending on the approaches applied and metrics used . Ocean circulation, habitat structures, nutrients and genetics can exhibit diverse connectivity patterns and a multidisciplinary approach is fundamental to obtain the best guidelines for MPA network design.\n
          Although a standardised global methodology for assessing marine connectivity is yet to be developed, there has been extensive research conducted to evaluate connectivity across the Wider Caribbean region        . A recent pilot study under the BIOPAMA programme  adapted the ProtConn indicator  to assess the importance of protected areas for seagrass habitat connectivity across the Caribbean . This study identified several data challenges and considerations for the marine realm, which will be incorporated into the development of a global marine ProtConn indicator. Figure 1 shows the configuration of seagrass across the Caribbean, 20% of which is under protection from sites recorded in the WDPA. When comparing the functional connectivity of the seagrass habitat network, regardless of protection status, to that of the network containing only protected sites, the unprotected areas boost the overall available habitat while increasing its relative reachability, largely through increases in stepping-stone connectivity."
