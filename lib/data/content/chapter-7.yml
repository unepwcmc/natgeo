subtitle: "Chapter seven"
intro: "Connectivity between protected areas is essential to maintain the viability of species, communities and ecosystems. Metrics to measure connectivity at the global level have been developed, and reveal that about half of the global protected area network consist in connected lands, and that 30% of countries currently meet the connectivity element of Aichi Target 11. There are at present, no available analyses of trends in protected area connectivity over time. However, many countries have now developed connectivity initiatives to enhance ecological connections between protected areas, in an effort to counter the ongoing fragmentation of ecosystems."
achi_text_2: "Connectivity is particularly important given the many threats faced by biodiversity, including from climate change, and the increasing isolation of natural habitats in many parts of the world. A number of initiatives have recently been developed at various scales to promote connectivity between protected areas and other conservation areas."
