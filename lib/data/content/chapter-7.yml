intro: "Connectivity between protected areas is essential to maintain the viability of species, communities and ecosystems. Metrics to measure connectivity at the global level have been developed, and reveal that about half of the global protected area network consist in connected lands, and that 30% of countries currently meet the connectivity element of Aichi Target 11. There are at present no available analyses of trends in protected area connectivity over time. However, many countries have now developed connectivity initiatives to enhance ecological connections between protected areas, in an effort to counter the ongoing fragmentation of ecosystems."
content_1: "Connectivity is particularly important given the many threats faced by biodiversity, including from climate change, and the increasing isolation of natural habitats in many parts of the world. A number of initiatives have recently been developed at various scales to promote connectivity between protected areas and other conservation areas."

cta_text: "This example shows how connectivity areas can be identified and provides recommendations on how to best address the impacts of human pressure on these corridors."

content_2: "At the global level, a new indicator, “Protected Connected” (ProtConn), was recently developed to quantify the degree to which national terrestrial protected area systems are well designed to promote connectivity. This study found that on average 7.5% of the terrestrial surface of the planet is covered by protected connected lands, which is about half of the global protected area coverage (14.7%), and that 30% of the countries currently meet the connectivity element of Aichi Target 11."
