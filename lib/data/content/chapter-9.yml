    "Aichi Target 11 states that protected areas and OECMs should be ‘integrated into the wider landscape and seascape’. For this section, this is considered to mean that protected and conserved areas should not act as islands for biodiversity while surrounding areas are neglected.  Instead, they should be part of a network of measures, both area-based and not, that together achieve conservation and sustainable development. "

    "Integration involves factoring protected and conserved areas into broader development planning, including local, national and regional spatial planning. It also means identifying and recognising the many ways in which protected and conserved areas enhance human well-being, including through the provision of ecosystem services like climate change mitigation (e.g. Maxwell et al., 2020; Dinerstein et al. 2019; Smith et al., in press), and through economic benefits (Box 13). Furthermore, it means recognising that protected and conserved areas will not save biodiversity unless they are just one element of a holistic, global commitment to environmental sustainability. The recently developed ‘three global conditions’ map is one attempt to facilitate biodiversity gains across all of the world’s lands, by dividing land into cities and farms, shared lands, and large wild areas, each requiring a different approach to conservation and sustainable use (Locke et al., 2019).  "

    "In 2018, Parties to the CBD recommended the application of voluntary guidance that includes actions to enhance policy integration, and provided guidance on mainstreaming of protected areas across sectors to contribute to the SDGs (CBD, 2018). There is also a need for greater coordination across biodiversity-related conventions (Rogalla von Bieberstein et al., 2018). To date, there are no agreed indicators for tracking progress on the ‘integrated’ element of Aichi Target 11 (Gannon et al., 2019). However, some inferences can be drawn by considering whether national and regional policies refer to integrated spatial planning. Many countries have yet to develop holistic spatial plans and incorporate these into relevant laws and policies, although some have described relevant strategies in their National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans, and others in their Nationally Determined Contributions for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In an example of regional coordination, the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 puts a strong emphasis on ecological corridors to facilitate species migration and maintain healthy ecosystems. It also encourages the integration of biodiversity considerations into public and business decision-making at all levels." 
  - "Another indirect way of estimating progress on this element is to measure ‘leakage’ (e.g. deforestation being displaced to the surrounding area) and ‘blockage’ (e.g. deforestation being reduced in surrounding areas) effects of protected areas on the surrounding landscape (Gannon et al., 2019). Recent studies have found that although protected areas are generally effective at preventing deforestation, leakage and blockage effects have been observed to varying degrees (e.g. Fuller et al. 2019; Ford et al., 2020).  "
  - "Protected and conserved areas have an important role to play in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals, including Goals 14 and 15 (Life on land and Life below water), Goal 3 (Good health and well-being), Goal 6 (Clean water and sanitation), Goal 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), and Goal 13 (Climate action). However, they cannot perform this role in isolation. Larger and more effective protected and conserved areas will not halt biodiversity loss unless there is sustainable management across the surrounding land and seascape. The shortfalls in meeting Aichi Targets 6 and 7 on sustainable use of natural resources (CBD, 2020) highlight the need for a greater emphasis on the ‘integrated’ element after 2020.   "
