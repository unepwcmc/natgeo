title: "Integrated into the Wider Landscape and Seascape"
subtitle: "Chapter nine"
intro: "Integrating protected and conserved areas into the wider landscape and seascape requires sound spatial and natural resource planning that maintains biodiversity values, while also contributing towards harmonized sectoral development. Tracking progress for this element remains difficult because very few countries have developed spatial plans to improve this integration and incorporated these plans into relevant laws and policies."
content: "Aichi Target 11 requires that protected and conserved areas be ‘integrated into the wider landscape and seascape’ i.e. that the design and management of protected areas, corridors and the surrounding matrix fosters a connected, functional ecological network”. Protected areas throughout the world are coming under widespread human pressures that have profound impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. "

content: "Some authors have used a revised Human Footprint map to measure habitat conversion and showed that in recent years protected area establishment outpaced habitat conversion across all biomes and the majority of ecoregions globally. It has also been shown that over the past two decades the Earth’s wilderness areas have been disappearing at a rate that has significantly outpaced their protection."
content: "To address gaps in knowledge, the National Geographic Society (NGS) is developing a Human Impact Map aimed at identifying the planet’s remaining, relatively untouched terrestrial landscapes. Based on these data, 20.4% of the earth’s remaining areas of low human impact are within protected areas, while 11.5% of the world is both protected and under low human impact."
